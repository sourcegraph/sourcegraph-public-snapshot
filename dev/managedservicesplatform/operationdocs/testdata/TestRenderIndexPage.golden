# Managed Services infrastructure

<!--
Generated from: unknown revision of https://github.com/sourcegraph/managed-services

These pages contain generated operational guidance for the infrastructure of [Managed Services Platform (MSP)](../teams/core-services/managed-services/platform.md) services.
This includes information about each service, configured environments, Entitle requests, common tasks, monitoring, etc.
In addition to service-specific guidance, [General guidance](#general-guidance) is also available.

MSP is owned by [Core Services](../teams/core-services/index.md), but individual teams are responsible for the services they operate on the platform.

Services are defined in [`sourcegraph/managed-services`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/managed-services), though service source code may live elsewhere.

> [!NOTE]
> This page may be out of date if a service or environment was recently added or updated - reach out to #discuss-core-services for help updating these pages, or use `sg msp operations $SERVICE_ID` to view the generated documentation in your terminal.

## General guidance

### Infrastructure access

For MSP service environments other than `category: test`, access needs to be requested through Entitle.
Test environments are placed in the "Engineering Projects" GCP folder, which should have access granted to engineers by default.

Entitle access to a production MSP project is most easily provisioned through the `mspServiceReader` and  custom roles, which provide read-only and editing access respectively.
You can request access to a project in Entitle by following these steps:

- Go to [app.entitle.io/request](https://app.entitle.io/request) and select **Specific Permission**
- Fill out the following:
  - Integration: **GCP Production Projects**
  - Resource types: **Project**
  - Resource: name of MSP project you are interested in
  - Role: `mspServiceReader` (or `mspServiceEditor` if you need additional privileges - use with care!)
  - Duration: choose your own adventure!

These custom roles are configured [in  in the infrastructure repo](https://github.com/sourcegraph/infrastructure/blob/main/gcp/custom-roles/msp.tf).

### Terraform Cloud access

Terraform Cloud (TFC) workspaces for MSP [can be found using the `msp` workspace tag](https://app.terraform.io/app/sourcegraph/workspaces?tag=msp).

To gain access to MSP project TFC workspaces, [log in to Terraform Cloud](https://app.terraform.io/app/sourcegraph) and _then_ [request membership to the `Managed Services Platform Operators` TFC team via Entitle](https://app.entitle.io/request?data=eyJkdXJhdGlvbiI6IjM2MDAiLCJqdXN0aWZpY2F0aW9uIjoiRU5URVIgSlVTVElGSUNBVElPTiBIRVJFIiwicm9sZUlkcyI6W3siaWQiOiJiMzg3MzJjYy04OTUyLTQ2Y2QtYmIxZS1lZjI2ODUwNzIyNmIiLCJ0aHJvdWdoIjoiYjM4NzMyY2MtODk1Mi00NmNkLWJiMWUtZWYyNjg1MDcyMjZiIiwidHlwZSI6InJvbGUifV19).
This TFC team has access to all MSP workspaces, and is [configured here](https://sourcegraph.sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/infrastructure/-/blob/terraform-cloud/terraform.tfvars?L44:1-48:4).

Note that you **must [log in to Terraform Cloud](https://app.terraform.io/app/sourcegraph) before making your Entitle request**.
If you make your Entitle request, then log in, you will be removed from any team memberships granted through Entitle by Terraform Cloud's SSO implementation.
