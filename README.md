We're building [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com) to keep you in
flow while coding.

Try Sourcegraph:

* [:mag_right: Search globally for functions, types, packages, etc.](https://sourcegraph.com/?q=http.NewRequest)
* [:zap: Browse and jump around code like an IDE](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/golang/go/-/def/GoPackage/net/http/-/NewRequest)
* [:earth_africa: See how a function/type/package is used everywhere](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/golang/go/-/info/GoPackage/net/http/-/NewRequest)

...all in your web browser. It just works. (Unless you do crazy stuff with your build tooling.)

It works across repositories and at large scale, with 2,000,000,000+
nodes in the public code index (and growing).

Tons of devs use Sourcegraph all day, every day—worldwide and inside
large, well-known companies.


### Supported languages

* Go

*Coming soon: Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, TypeScript, PHP, Objective-C, Scala, CSS, etc.*



## Getting started

private code. New, paid features will be released publicly in the
future ([contact us for more info](mailto:support@sourcegraph.com)).
