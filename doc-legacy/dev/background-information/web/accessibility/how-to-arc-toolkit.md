In summary:

- Open the Toolkit through the "ARC Toolkit" tab in Chrome DevTools.
- Click "Run Tests" to start an audit on the current webpage.
  - **Note:** tests will not automatically rerun when the page is interacted with.
- In the left panel, click on a test group to see specific information (e.g. any problems related to Headings).
 - Use this to filter the audit to a section of the [accessibility checklist](detailed-checklist.md) that you are interested in.
- In the right panel, view all warnings and errors related to a specific test group.
  - Use this to quickly find significant errors and drill down to individual problems on the page.
