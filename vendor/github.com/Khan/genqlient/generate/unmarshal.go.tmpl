{{/* We need to generate UnmarshalJSON methods for some types that we want to
     handle specially.  Specifically, we generate an UnmarshalJSON for each
     struct with a field meeting any of these criteria:
        - a field whose type is configured with a custom unmarshaler
        - an embedded (anonymous) field; technically we only need an
          UnmarshalJSON if the embedded type needs one, but it's easier to
          generate it unconditionally
        - a field of interface type
     Additionally, since we add `json:"-"` to fields we handle specially, for
     any field which requires a MarshalJSON, we also generate an UnmarshalJSON,
     and vice versa.

     Given that, we want to specially handle the above-described fields, but
     unmarshal everything else normally.  To handle fields with custom
     unmarshalers, first we unmarshal them into a json.RawMessage, then call
     the custom unmarshaler.  Interface-typed fields are similar, except
     instead of a custom unmarshaler we call the helper we've generated
     (see unmarshal_helper.go.tmpl).  Embedded fields don't need the
     json.RawMessage; we just unmarshal our input again into the embedded
     field. */}}

    {{/* For our first pass, we ignore embedded fields, unmarshal all the
         custom-unmarshaler or abstract fields into json.RawMessage, and
         unmarshal everything else normally.  To do this, we want to call
         json.Unmarshal on the receiver (v).  But if we do that naively on a
         value of type <.GoName>, it will call this function again, and recurse
         infinitely.  So we make a wrapper type which embeds both this type and
         NoUmnarshalJSON, which prevents either's UnmarshalJSON method from
         being promoted.  For more on why this is so difficult, see
         https://github.com/benjaminjkraft/notes/blob/master/go-json-interfaces.md.
         (Note there are a few different ways "hide" the method, but this one
         seems to be the best option that works if this type has embedded types
         with UnmarshalJSON methods.)

         unmarshaler (our unmarshal-helper, or the user-specified one,
         respectively).  This gets a little complicated because we may have
         a slice field.  So what we do is basically, for each field of type
         `[][]...[]MyType`:

            dst := &v.MyField      // *[][]...[]MyType
            src := firstPass.MyField  // [][]...[]json.RawMessage

            // repeat the following three lines n times; each time, inside
            // the loop we have one less layer of slice on src and dst
            *dst = make([][]...[]MyType, len(src))
            for i, src := range src {
                // We need the &(*dst)[i] because at each stage we want to
                // keep dst as a pointer.  (It only really has to be a
                // pointer at the innermost level, but it's easiest to be
                // consistent.)
                dst := &(*dst)[i]
           
                // (now we have `dst *MyType` and `src json.RawMessage`)
                __unmarshalMyType(dst, src)

            } // (also n times)

         Note that if the field also uses a pointer (`[][]...[]*MyType`), we
         now pass around `*[][]...[]*MyType`; again in principle
         `[][]...[]*MyType` would work but require more special-casing.  Thus
         in the innermost loop, `dst` is of type `**MyType`, so we have to
         pass `*dst` to the unmarshaler.  Of course, since MyType is an
         interface, I'm not sure why you'd any of that anyway.

         One additional trick is we wrap everything above in a block ({ ... }),
         so that the variables dst and src may take on different types for
         each field we are handling, which would otherwise conflict.  (We could
         instead suffix the names, but that makes things much harder to read.)
