// Stream is used to execute a stream of tasks concurrently while maintaining
// the order of the results.
//
// To use a stream, you submit some number of `Task`s, each of which
// return a callback. Each task will be executed concurrently in the stream's
// associated Pool, and the callbacks will be executed sequentially in the
// order the tasks were submitted.
//
// Once all your tasks have been submitted, Wait() must be called to clean up
// running goroutines and propagate any panics.
//
// In the case of panic during execution of a task or a callback, all other
// tasks and callbacks will still execute. The panic will be propagated to the
// caller when Wait() is called.
//
// A Stream is efficient, but not zero cost. It should not be used for very
// short tasks. Startup and teardown adds an overhead of a couple of
// microseconds, and the overhead for each task is roughly 500ns. It should be
// good enough for any task that requires a network call.
