# Go language server (based on the Language Server Protocol) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sourcegraph/sourcegraph-go.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/sourcegraph/sourcegraph-go)

langserver-go is a [Go](https://golang.org) language server that speaks [Language Server Protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol). It supports editor features such as go-to-definition, hover, and find-references for Go projects.

The `./vscode` directory contains a [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) extension that provides Go language support using this language server.
