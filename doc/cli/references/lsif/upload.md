# `src lsif upload`


## Flags

| Name | Description | Default Value |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| `-associated-index-id` | ID of the associated index record for this upload. For internal use only. | `-1` |
| `-commit` | The 40-character hash of the commit. Defaults to the currently checked-out commit. |  |
| `-file` | The path to the LSIF dump file. | `./dump.lsif` |
| `-github-token` | A GitHub access token with 'public_repo' scope that Sourcegraph uses to verify you have access to the repository. |  |

| `-ignore-upload-failure` | Exit with status code zero on upload failure. | `false` |
| `-indexer` | The name of the indexer that generated the dump. This will override the 'toolInfo.name' field in the metadata vertex of the LSIF dump file. This must be supplied if the indexer does not set this field (in which case the upload will fail with an explicit message). |  |

| `-open` | Open the LSIF upload page in your browser. | `false` |
| `-repo` | The name of the repository (e.g. github.com/gorilla/mux). By default, derived from the origin remote. |  |
| `-root` | The path in the repository that matches the LSIF projectRoot (e.g. cmd/project1). Defaults to the directory where the dump file is located. |  |
| `-trace` | -trace=0 shows no logs; -trace=1 shows requests and response metadata; -trace=2 shows headers, -trace=3 shows response body | `0` |
