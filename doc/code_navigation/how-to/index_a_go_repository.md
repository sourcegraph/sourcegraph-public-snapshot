# Go LSIF Indexing

This guide is meant to provide specific instructions to get you producing index data in LSIF as quickly as possible for Go codebases.

## Automated indexing

We provide the docker images `sourcegraph/lsif-go` and `sourcegraph/src-cli` to make automating this process in your favorite CI framework as easy as possible. Note that the `lsif-go` image bundles `src-cli` so the second image may not be necessary.

Here's some examples in a couple popular frameworks, just substitute the indexer and upload commands with what works for your project locally. If you end up implementing this in a different framework, feel free to edit this page with instructions!

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
on:
  - push

jobs:
  lsif-go:
    # this line will prevent forks of this repo from uploading lsif indexes
    if: github.repository == '<insert your repo name>'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: sourcegraph/lsif-go:latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Generate LSIF data
        run: lsif-go
      - name: Upload LSIF data
        # this will upload to Sourcegraph.com, you may need to substitute a different command.
        # by default, we ignore failures to avoid disrupting CI pipelines with non-critical errors.
        run: src code-intel upload -github-token=${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} -ignore-upload-failure
```

The following projects have example GitHub Action workflows to generate and upload LSIF indexes.

- [golang/go](https://github.com/sourcegraph-codeintel-showcase/go/blob/f40606b1241b0ca4802d7b00a763241b03404eea/.github/workflows/lsif.yml)
- [kubernetes/kubernetes](https://github.com/sourcegraph-codeintel-showcase/kubernetes/blob/359b6469d85cc7cd4f6634e50651633eefeaea4e/.github/workflows/lsif.yml)
- [moby/moby](https://github.com/sourcegraph-codeintel-showcase/moby/blob/380429abb05846de773d5aa07de052f40c9e8208/.github/workflows/lsif.yml)

### CircleCI

```yaml
version: 2.1

jobs:
  lsif-go:
    docker:
      - image: sourcegraph/lsif-go:latest
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: lsif-go
        # this will upload to Sourcegraph.com, you may need to substitute a different command.
        # by default, we ignore failures to avoid disrupting CI pipelines with non-critical errors.
      - run: src code-intel upload -github-token=<<parameters.github-token>> -ignore-upload-failure

workflows:
  scip-typescript:
    jobs:
      - scip-typescript
```

The following projects have example CircleCI configurations to generate and upload LSIF indexes.

- [grafana](https://github.com/sourcegraph-codeintel-showcase/grafana/blob/664a694955ea40575a1cffe9db47a7adf4d3c2bb/.circleci/config.yml)
- [helm](https://github.com/sourcegraph-codeintel-showcase/helm/blob/62c38f152d0802719aad1ec4c1c281f01dc75173/.circleci/config.yml)
- [prometheus/prometheus](https://github.com/sourcegraph-codeintel-showcase/prometheus/blob/a0a8a249fff9d1c6ce4c097ccc4f5e120c723c51/.circleci/config.yml)

### Travis CI

```yaml
services:
  - docker

jobs:
  include:
    - stage: lsif-go
      # this will upload to Sourcegraph.com, you may need to substitute a different command.
      # by default, we ignore failures to avoid disrupting CI pipelines with non-critical errors.
      script:
      - |
        docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/src -w /src sourcegraph/lsif-go:latest /bin/sh -c \
          "lsif-go; src code-intel upload -github-token=$GITHUB_TOKEN -ignore-upload-failure"
```

The following projects have example Travis CI configurations to generate and upload LSIF indexes.

- [aws/aws-sdk-go](https://github.com/sourcegraph-codeintel-showcase/aws-sdk-go/blob/92f67a061fcdd46d6a418b28838b10b6ac63a880/.travis.yml)
- [etcd-io/etcd](https://github.com/sourcegraph-codeintel-showcase/etcd/blob/eae726706fe8ebf7e08b45ba29a70388595db31b/.travis.yml)
- [hugo/hugo](https://github.com/sourcegraph-codeintel-showcase/hugo/blob/6704b7c125d7b21ccf2048d7bff0f1ffe2b0867d/.travis.yml)

## Manual indexing

1. Install [lsif-go](https://github.com/sourcegraph/lsif-go)

1. Install the [Sourcegraph CLI](https://github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli) with

   ```
   curl -L https://sourcegraph.com/.api/src-cli/src_linux_amd64 -o /usr/local/bin/src
   chmod +x /usr/local/bin/src
   ```

   - **macOS**: replace `linux` with `darwin` in the URL, choose the appropriate architecture: M1/M2 chips - `arm64`, Intel chips - `amd64`
   - **Windows**: visit [the CLI's repo](https://github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli) for further instructions

1. `cd` into your Go project's root (where the go.mod file lives, if you have one) and run:

   ```
   lsif-go # generates a file named dump.lsif
   ```

1. Upload the data to a Sourcegraph instance with

   ```
   # for private instances
   src -endpoint=<your sourcegraph endpoint> lsif upload
   # for public instances
   src code-intel upload -github-token=<your github token>
   ```

The upload command will provide a URL you can visit to see the upload's status, and when it's done you can visit the repo and check out the difference in code navigation quality!
