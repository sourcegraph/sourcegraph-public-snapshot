# Licensing and Limited Access

## License 

Instances need a license key with the `code-insights` tag to have full access to Code Insights features, or they need to be on the new 2022 "Business" or "Enterprise" plans. 

## Limited Access 

If an instance does not have full access via the correct license key, then at most, an Enterprise plan instance can have a maximum of two global code insights for "free" without having a license.

The in-search aggregations feature that appears on the search UI is available to all users on any license, but future features, like saving those aggregations to dashboards, would require an insights-including license.
