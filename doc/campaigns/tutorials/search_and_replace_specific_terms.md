Create a campaign that changes wording in every repository.

### Introduction

This tutorial shows you how to create [a campaign spec](../explanations/introduction_to_campaigns.md#campaign-spec) that replaces the words `whitelist` and `blacklist` with `allowlist` and `denylist` in every Markdown file across your entire code base.

The campaign spec can be easily changed to search and replace other terms in other file types.

### Prerequisites

We recommend using the latest version of Sourcegraph when working with campaigns and that you have a basic understanding of how to create campaign specs and run them. See the following documents for more information:

1. ["Quickstart"](../quickstart.md)
1. ["Introduction to campaigns"](../explanations/introduction_to_campaigns.md)

### Create the campaign spec

Save the following campaign spec YAML as `allowlist-denylist.campaign.yaml`:

```yaml
name: use-allowlist-denylist-wording
description: This campaign updates our Markdown docs to use the terms "allowlist" and "denylist" instead of "whitelist" and "blacklist".

# Search for repositories in which the term "whitelist" or "blacklist" appears
# in Markdown files.
on:
  - repositoriesMatchingQuery: whitelist OR blacklist lang:markdown -file:vendor -file:node_modules

# In each repository
steps:
  # find all *.md or *.markdown files, that are not in a vendor or node_modules
  # folder, and replace the terms in them:
  - run: |
      find . -type f \( -name '*.md' -or -name '*.markdown' \) -not -path "*/vendor/*" -not -path "*/node_modules/*" |\
      xargs sed -i 's/whitelist/allowlist/g; s/blacklist/denylist/g'
    container: alpine:3

# Describe the changeset (e.g., GitHub pull request) you want for each repository.
changesetTemplate:
  title: Replace whitelist/blacklist with allowlist/denylist
  body: This replaces the terms whitelist/blacklist in Markdown files with allowlist/denylist
  branch: campaigns/allowlist-denylist # Push the commit to this branch.
  commit:
    message: Replace whitelist/blacklist with allowlist/denylist
  published: false
```

### Create the campaign

1. In your terminal, run this command:

    <pre>src campaign preview -f use-allowlist-denylist-wording.campaign.yaml -namespace <em>USERNAME_OR_ORG</em></pre>

    > The `namespace` is either your Sourcegraph username or the name of a Sourcegraph organisation under which you want to create the campaign. If you're not sure what to choose, use your username.
1. Wait for it to run and compute the changes for each repository.

1. Open the preview URL that the command printed out.
    <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/docs/images/campaigns/tutorials/use_allowlist_denylist_wording_click_url.png" class="screenshot">
1. Examine the preview. Confirm that the changes are what you intended. If not, edit your campaign spec and then rerun the command above.

1. Click the **Apply spec** button to create the campaign.
1. Feel free to then publish the changesets (i.e. create pull requests and merge requests) by [modifying the `published` attribute in the campaign spec](../references/campaign_spec_yaml_reference.md#changesettemplate-published) and re-running the `src campaign preview` command.

### Using `ruplacer` to replace terms in multiple case styles

With [ruplacer](https://github.com/TankerHQ/ruplacer) we can easily search and replace terms in multiple case styles: `white_list`, `WhiteList`, `WHITE_LIST` etc.

The easiest way to use `ruplacer` in our campaign spec would look like this:

```yaml
steps:
    # Install and use ruplacer to replace words in case-style variations
  - run: |
      cargo install ruplacer \
      && find . -type f \( -name '*.md' -or -name '*.markdown' \) -not -path "*/vendor/*" -not -path "*/node_modules/*" >> /tmp/find_result.txt \
      && cat /tmp/find_result.txt | while read file;
      do
        ruplacer --subvert whitelist allowlist --go ${file} || echo "nothing to replace";
        ruplacer --subvert blacklist denylist --go ${file} || echo "nothing to replace";
      done
    # Use the rust image in our container
    container: rust
```

But there's a problem with that approach: every new execution of `src campaign preview` has to execute the `cargo install ruplacer` command again. And if you're tweaking which terms you're replacing, that performance cost can become too much quite fast.

A better option would be to to build a small Docker image in which `ruplacer` is already installed.

To do that, save the following in a `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM rust
RUN cargo install ruplacer
```

Then build a Docker image out of it, tagged with `ruplacer`, by running the following command in your terminal:

```
docker build . -t ruplacer
```

Once that is done, we can use the following `steps` in our campaign spec:

```yaml
steps:
  - run: |
      find . -type f \( -name '*.md' -or -name '*.markdown' \) -not -path "*/vendor/*" -not -path "*/node_modules/*" >> /tmp/find_result.txt \
      && cat /tmp/find_result.txt | while read file;
      do
        ruplacer --subvert whitelist allowlist --go ${file} || echo "nothing to replace";
        ruplacer --subvert blacklist denylist --go ${file} || echo "nothing to replace";
      done
    # Use the newly-built ruplacer image
    container: ruplacer
```

Save the file and run the `src campaign preview` command from above again to use `ruplacer` to replace variations of terms.
