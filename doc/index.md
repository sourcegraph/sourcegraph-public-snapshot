# Sourcegraph documentation

[Sourcegraph](https://about.sourcegraph.com) is a web-based, self-hosted code search and navigation tool for developers, used by Uber, Lyft, Yelp, and more.

## Quickstart guide

It takes less than 5 minutes to run and install Sourcegraph using Docker:

<!--
  DO NOT CHANGE THIS TO A CODEBLOCK.
  We want line breaks for readability, but backslashes to escape them do not work cross-platform.
  This uses line breaks that are rendered but not copy-pasted to the clipboard.
-->

<pre class="pre-wrap start-sourcegraph-command"><code>docker run<span class="virtual-br"></span> --publish 7080:7080 --publish 127.0.0.1:3370:3370 --rm<span class="virtual-br"></span> --volume ~/.sourcegraph/config:/etc/sourcegraph<span class="virtual-br"></span> --volume ~/.sourcegraph/data:/var/opt/sourcegraph<span class="virtual-br"></span> sourcegraph/server:3.10.4</code></pre>

Once the server is ready (logo is displayed in the terminal), navigate to the hostname or IP address on port `7080`.  Create the admin account, then you'll be guided through setting up Sourcegraph for code searching and navigation.

> NOTE: If you run Docker on an OS such as RHEL, Fedora, or CentOS with SELinux enabled, sVirt doesn't allow the Docker process
to access `~/.sourcegraph/config` and `~/.sourcegraph/data`. In that case, you will see the following message:

> `Failed to setup nginx:failed to generate nginx configuration to /etc/sourcegraph: open /etc/sourcegraph/nginx.conf: permission denied`.

> To fix this, run:

> `mkdir -p ~/.sourcegraph/config ~/.sourcegraph/data && chcon -R -t svirt_sandbox_file_t ~/.sourcegraph/config ~/.sourcegraph/data`

## Upgrading Sourcegraph

All you need to do to upgrade Sourcegraph is to restart your Docker server with a new image tag.

We actively maintain the two most recent monthly releases of Sourcegraph, and we support upgrading from the two previous monthly releases.

For example, if you are running Sourcegraph 3.1, then you can upgrade directly to 3.2 and 3.3. If you want to upgrade to 3.4, then you first need to upgrade to 3.3 before you can upgrade to 3.4.

> The Docker server image tags follow SemVer semantics, so version 3.8 can be found at `sourcegraph/server:3.10.4`. You can see the full list of tags on our [Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/sourcegraph/server/tags).
