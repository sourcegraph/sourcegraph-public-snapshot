# Updating Go import statements using Comby

This campaign rewrites Go import paths for the `log15` package from `gopkg.in/inconshreveable/log15.v2` to `github.com/inconshreveable/log15` using [Comby](https://comby.dev/).

It can handle single-package import statements like these

```go
import "gopkg.in/inconshreveable/log15.v2"
```

and multi-package import statements like these:

```go
import (
	"io"

	"github.com/pkg/errors"
	"gopkg.in/inconshreveable/log15.v2"
)
```
