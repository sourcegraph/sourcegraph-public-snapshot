# Campaign drafts

A campaign can be created as a draft, either by adding the `-draft` flag to the `src campaign create` command, or by selecting `Create draft` in the web UI. 

When a campaign is a draft, no changesets will be created until the campaign is published, or each changeset is individually published. This can be done in the Sourcegraph campaign web interface.
