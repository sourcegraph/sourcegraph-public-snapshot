# Developing code intelligence

This guide documents our approach to developing code intelligence-related features in our codebase. This includes the code intelligence [subsystems](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/tree/main/enterprise/cmd) and the [extensions](https://github.com/sourcegraph/code-intel-extensions) that provide code intelligence to the web UI, browser extension, and code host integrations.
