## Install `sg`

At Sourcegraph we use [`sg`, the Sourcegraph developer tool](../background-information/sg/index.md), to manage our local development environment.

To install `sg`, run the following in your terminal:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSLf https://install.sg.dev | sh
```

See the [`sg` documentation](../background-information/sg/index.md) for more information or ask in the `#dev-experience` Slack channel.

## Ensure you have SSH setup for GitHub

Follow the instructions on [Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) for checking if you have an existing SSH for your current machine and setting one up if not.

## Run `sg setup`

In the directory where you want the `sourcegraph` repository to be checked out, open a terminal and run the following command:

```sh
sg setup
```

Follow the printed instructions, which will guide you through the installation of all the necessary dependencies to start the local development environment.

## Run databases

If you chose to run PostgreSQL and Redis **without Docker** (recommended) they should already be running. You can jump to the next section.

If you chose to run Redis and PostgreSQL **with Docker**, we need to run them:

```sh
sg run redis-postgres
```

Keep this process running and follow the rest of the instructions in another terminal.

## Start Sourcegraph

**If you are a Sourcegraph employee**, start the local development server for Sourcegraph Enterprise with the following command:

```sh
sg start
```

This will continuously compile your code and live reload your locally running instance of Sourcegraph.

Navigate your browser to https://sourcegraph.test:3443 to see if everything worked.

Congratulations on making it to the end of the quickstart guide!

### Running Sourcegraph in different configurations

If you want to run Sourcegraph in different configurations (with the monitoring stack, with code insights enabled...), run the following:

```sh
sg start -help
```

That prints a list of possible configurations which you can start with `sg start`.

For example, you can start Sourcegraph in the mode it uses on Sourcegraph.com by running the following in one terminal window

```sh
sg start dotcom
```

and then, in another terminal window, start the monitoring stack:

```sh
sg start monitoring
```
