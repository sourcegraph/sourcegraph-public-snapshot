# Testing

## Running tests locally

To run tests for the Go source code, run `go test ./...`, or specify a package
directly, `go test ./util/textutil`.

To run tests for the website, run `yarn run test`.

To run the end-to-end tests for the website: `yarn run test-e2e`. See
[web app development documentation](web_app.md) for more information.

### Continuous Integration

The test suite is exercised on every pull request. For the moment CI output
access is limited to Sourcegraph employees, though we hope to enable public
read-only access soon.

The test pipeline is generated by `dev/ci/gen-pipeline.go`, and written to a
YAML file by dev/ci/init-pipeline.yml. This pipeline is immediately scheduled by
Buildkite to run on the Sourcegraph build farm. Some things that are tested
include:

- all of the Go source files that have tests
- dev/check/all.sh (gofmt, lint, go generator, no Security TODO's, Bash syntax, others)
- JS formatting/linting (prettier, tslint, stylelint, graphql-lint)
- Dockerfile linter (hadolint)
- Check whether the Go module folders are "tidy" (go mod tidy)
