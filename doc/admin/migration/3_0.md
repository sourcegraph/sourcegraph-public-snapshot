# Migrating to Sourcegraph 3.0.1+

3.0 includes a few major product and configuration changes that you should be aware of if you are upgrading an existing instance.

## PostgreSQL upgrade

> WARNING: ⚠️ Because `3.0.1` [upgrades the PostgreSQL version](../postgres.md):
>
>* Anyone upgrading from `2.x` to `3.0.1+`, or from `3.0.0` to `3.0.1+` MUST follow the [Upgrading PostgreSQL](../postgres.md) instructions below.
>* It will not be possible to downgrade from `3.0.1+` to `2.x` unless you also restore your PostgreSQL database from a `2.x` snapshot.

The version of PostgreSQL that ships with Sourcegraph `3.0.1` has been upgraded to `11.1` for all deployments.

👉 Follow the [upgrade instructions](../postgres.md) to safely migrate your data.

If you are connecting Sourcegraph to an external PostgreSQL database, the minimum supported version is `12`.

## Zero configuration code navigation is on by default for 10 languages

The [sourcegraph/basic-code-intel](https://sourcegraph.com/extensions/sourcegraph/basic-code-intel) extension has been deprecated and split into one extension per language, with the top 10 [programming language extensions](https://sourcegraph.com/extensions?query=category%3A"Programming+languages") enabled by default.

If you have [sourcegraph/basic-code-intel](https://sourcegraph.com/extensions/sourcegraph/basic-code-intel) enabled, disable it and enable any additional extensions for languages you use.

If you were running language servers with 2.x from the `https://sourcegraph.example.com/site-admin/code-intelligence` page, you will need to enable the corresponding [Sourcegraph language extensions](https://sourcegraph.com/extensions?query=category%3A"Programming+languages") and follow the READMEs to set up language servers and to point the extensions to those language servers.

## Repositories are managed by configuring external services

Top level configuration options for code hosts (e.g. "github", "gitlab", "phabricator", "awscodecommit", "bitbucket", "gitolite") have been removed from [site configuration](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/site_config/all).

The configuration of code hosts and repositories has moved to the external services UI at `https://sourcegraph.example.com/site-admin/external-services`.

The data from your existing site configuration will be automatically migrated when you upgrade to 3.0, so **no action is required**.

## `repos.list` was removed from site configuration

The top-level `repos.list` site configuration was removed in favour of each code-host's equivalent options, now configured via [external services](#Repositories-are-managed-by-configuring-external-services). Equivalent options in code hosts configuration:
  - GitHub via [`github.repos`](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/site_config/all#repos-array)
  - GitLab via [`gitlab.projectQuery`](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/site_config/all#projectquery-array)
  - Phabricator via [`phabricator.repos`](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/site_config/all#phabricator-array)
  - [Other external services](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/repo/add_from_other_external_services)

## Configuration is now stored in the database, not in a config.json file

Sourcegraph configuration is now stored in the PostgreSQL database, not in a configuration file. Editing the configuration is now only possible through the web UI (even in cluster deployments). Critical Sourcegraph configuration is stored in the management console.

When you first start 3.0, the old configuration file will be copied into the database to populate the site configuration and management console. After this, you should delete that file as it will no longer be respected.

For single-node deployments (`sourcegraph/server`), this file is `/etc/sourcegraph/sourcegraph-config.json` inside the Docker container.

For Kubernetes cluster deployments, this is your `config-file` config map (`deploy-sourcegraph/base/config-file.ConfigMap.yaml`).

## Some site configuration options have moved to the new management console

The following options have moved into the management console:

```
auth.providers
auth.public
auth.sessionExpiry
auth.userOrgMap
externalURL
htmlBodyBottom
htmlBodyTop
htmlHeadBottom
htmlHeadTop
licenseKey
lightstepAccessToken
lightstepProject
log
update.channel
useJaeger
```
