## frontend: 99th_percentile_search_request_duration

<p class="subtitle">99th percentile successful search request duration over 5m</p>

**Descriptions**

- <span class="badge badge-warning">warning</span> frontend: 20s+ 99th percentile successful search request duration over 5m

**Next steps**

- **Get details on the exact queries that are slow** by configuring `"observability.logSlowSearches": 20,` in the site configuration and looking for `frontend` warning logs prefixed with `slow search request` for additional details.
- **Check that most repositories are indexed** by visiting https://sourcegraph.example.com/site-admin/repositories?filter=needs-index (it should show few or no results.)
- **Kubernetes:** Check CPU usage of zoekt-webserver in the indexed-search pod, consider increasing CPU limits in the `indexed-search.Deployment.yaml` if regularly hitting max CPU utilization.
- **Docker Compose:** Check CPU usage on the Zoekt Web Server dashboard, consider increasing `cpus:` of the zoekt-webserver container in `docker-compose.yml` if regularly hitting max CPU utilization.
- Learn more about the related dashboard panel in the [dashboards reference](./dashboards.md#frontend-99th-percentile-search-request-duration).
- **Silence this alert:** If you are aware of this alert and want to silence notifications for it, add the following to your site configuration and set a reminder to re-evaluate the alert:

```json
"observability.silenceAlerts": [
  "warning_frontend_99th_percentile_search_request_duration"

- <span class="badge badge-critical">critical</span> gitserver: less than 10% disk space remaining by instance for 10m0s

**Next steps**

- On a warning alert, you may want to provision more disk space: Sourcegraph may be about to start evicting repositories due to disk pressure, which may result in decreased performance, users having to wait for repositories to clone, etc.
- On a critical alert, you need to provision more disk space: Sourcegraph should be evicting repositories from disk, but is either filling up faster than it can evict, or there is an issue with the janitor job.

**Next steps**

- **Check if the problem may be an intermittent and temporary peak** using the "Container monitoring" section at the bottom of the Git Server dashboard.
- **Single container deployments:** Consider upgrading to a [Docker Compose deployment](../deploy/docker-compose/migrate.md) which offers better scalability and resource isolation.
- **Kubernetes and Docker Compose:** Check that you are running a similar number of git server replicas and that their CPU/memory limits are allocated according to what is shown in the [Sourcegraph resource estimator](../deploy/resource_estimator.md).

**Descriptions**

- <span class="badge badge-critical">critical</span> postgres: less than 0 database availability for 5m0s

**Next steps**

- **Kubernetes:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `kubectl describe pod (pgsql|codeintel-db|codeinsights)` (look for `OOMKilled: true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit in the relevant `Deployment.yaml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `kubectl logs -p (pgsql|codeintel-db|codeinsights)`.
	- Check if there is any OOMKILL event using the provisioning panels
	- Check kernel logs using `dmesg` for OOMKILL events on worker nodes
- **Docker Compose:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `docker inspect -f '{{json .State}}' (pgsql|codeintel-db|codeinsights)` (look for `"OOMKilled":true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit of the (pgsql|codeintel-db|codeinsights) container in `docker-compose.yml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `docker logs (pgsql|codeintel-db|codeinsights)` (note this will include logs from the previous and currently running container).
	- Check if there is any OOMKILL event using the provisioning panels

- **Single-container deployments:** Check `docker logs $CONTAINER_ID` for logs starting with `repo-updater` that indicate requests to the frontend service are failing.
- **Kubernetes:**
	- Confirm that `kubectl get pods` shows the `frontend` pods are healthy.
	- Check `kubectl logs symbols` for logs indicate request failures to `frontend` or `frontend-internal`.
- **Docker Compose:**
	- Confirm that `docker ps` shows the `frontend-internal` container is healthy.
	- Check `docker logs symbols` for logs indicating request failures to `frontend` or `frontend-internal`.

**Next steps**

- If you are running out of memory map areas, you could resolve this by:

    - Enabling shard merging for Zoekt: Set SRC_ENABLE_SHARD_MERGING="1" for zoekt-indexserver. Use this option
if your corpus of repositories has a high percentage of small, rarely updated repositories. See
[documentation](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search/explanations/search_details#shard-merging).
    - Creating additional Zoekt replicas: This spreads all the shards out amongst more replicas, which
means that each _individual_ replica will have fewer shards. This, in turn, decreases the
amount of memory map areas that a _single_ replica can create (in order to load the shards into memory).
    - Increasing the virtual memory subsystem`s "max_map_count" parameter which defines the upper limit of memory areas
a process can use. The default value of max_map_count is usually 65536. We recommend to set this value to 2x the number
of repos to be indexed per Zoekt instance. This means, if you want to index 240k repositories with 3 Zoekt instances,
set max_map_count to (240000 / 3) * 2 = 160000. The exact instructions for tuning this parameter can differ depending
on your environment. See https://kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt for more information.
- More help interpreting this metric is available in the [dashboards reference](./dashboards.md#zoekt-memory-map-areas-percentage-used).
- **Silence this alert:** If you are aware of this alert and want to silence notifications for it, add the following to your site configuration and set a reminder to re-evaluate the alert:

```json
