#### frontend: container_missing

This panel indicates container missing.

This value is the number of times a container has not been seen for more than one minute. If you observe this
value change independent of deployment events (such as an upgrade), it could indicate pods are being OOM killed or terminated for some other reasons.

- **Kubernetes:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `kubectl describe pod (frontend|sourcegraph-frontend)` (look for `OOMKilled: true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit in the relevant `Deployment.yaml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `kubectl logs -p (frontend|sourcegraph-frontend)`.
- **Docker Compose:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `docker inspect -f '{{json .State}}' (frontend|sourcegraph-frontend)` (look for `"OOMKilled":true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit of the (frontend|sourcegraph-frontend) container in `docker-compose.yml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `docker logs (frontend|sourcegraph-frontend)` (note this will include logs from the previous and currently running container).

#### gitserver: echo_command_duration_test

This panel indicates echo test command duration.

A high value here likely indicates a problem, especially if consistently high.
You can query for individual commands using `sum by (cmd)(src_gitserver_exec_running)` in Grafana (`/-/debug/grafana`) to see if a specific Git Server command might be spiking in frequency.

If this value is consistently high, consider the following:

- **Single container deployments:** Upgrade to a [Docker Compose deployment](../install/docker-compose/migrate.md) which offers better scalability and resource isolation.
- **Kubernetes and Docker Compose:** Check that you are running a similar number of git server replicas and that their CPU/memory limits are allocated according to what is shown in the [Sourcegraph resource estimator](../install/resource_estimator.md).

#### gitserver: container_missing

This panel indicates container missing.

This value is the number of times a container has not been seen for more than one minute. If you observe this
value change independent of deployment events (such as an upgrade), it could indicate pods are being OOM killed or terminated for some other reasons.

- **Kubernetes:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `kubectl describe pod gitserver` (look for `OOMKilled: true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit in the relevant `Deployment.yaml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `kubectl logs -p gitserver`.
- **Docker Compose:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `docker inspect -f '{{json .State}}' gitserver` (look for `"OOMKilled":true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit of the gitserver container in `docker-compose.yml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `docker logs gitserver` (note this will include logs from the previous and currently running container).

#### query-runner: container_missing

This panel indicates container missing.

This value is the number of times a container has not been seen for more than one minute. If you observe this
value change independent of deployment events (such as an upgrade), it could indicate pods are being OOM killed or terminated for some other reasons.

- **Kubernetes:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `kubectl describe pod query-runner` (look for `OOMKilled: true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit in the relevant `Deployment.yaml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `kubectl logs -p query-runner`.
- **Docker Compose:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `docker inspect -f '{{json .State}}' query-runner` (look for `"OOMKilled":true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit of the query-runner container in `docker-compose.yml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `docker logs query-runner` (note this will include logs from the previous and currently running container).

- **Kubernetes:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `kubectl describe pod symbols` (look for `OOMKilled: true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit in the relevant `Deployment.yaml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `kubectl logs -p symbols`.
- **Docker Compose:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `docker inspect -f '{{json .State}}' symbols` (look for `"OOMKilled":true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit of the symbols container in `docker-compose.yml`.

<br />

#### executor-queue: container_missing

This panel indicates container missing.

This value is the number of times a container has not been seen for more than one minute. If you observe this
value change independent of deployment events (such as an upgrade), it could indicate pods are being OOM killed or terminated for some other reasons.

- **Kubernetes:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `kubectl describe pod executor-queue` (look for `OOMKilled: true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit in the relevant `Deployment.yaml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `kubectl logs -p executor-queue`.
- **Docker Compose:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `docker inspect -f '{{json .State}}' executor-queue` (look for `"OOMKilled":true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit of the executor-queue container in `docker-compose.yml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `docker logs executor-queue` (note this will include logs from the previous and currently running container).
