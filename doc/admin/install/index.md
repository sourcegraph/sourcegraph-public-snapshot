> NOTE: Kubernetes with Helm deployment times vary based on the level and complexity of customizations you require.

> WARNING: Some features for self-hosted deployments [require a Sourcegraph license](https://about.sourcegraph.com/pricing/).

### Tips

* **We recommend Kubernetes with Helm for most  production deployments**.
   *  Kubernetes provides resource isolation (from other services or applications), automated-healing, and far greater ability to scale.
   *  Helm provides a simple mechanism for deployment customizations, as well as a much simpler upgrade experience.
* If you are unable to use Helm to deploy, but still want to use Kubernetes, see the [Kubernetes guide](kubernetes/index.md). 
* Note that for a Kubernetes deployments, more advanced customizations and use of Kubernetes without Helm both make it more necessary to have existing Kubernetes expertise within your company. If in any doubt about your team's ability to support this, please either stick to use of Helm or speak to your Sourcegraph contact about using Docker Compose instead.

### Resource estimator

Use the [resource estimator](resource_estimator.md) to find a good starting point for your deployment.
