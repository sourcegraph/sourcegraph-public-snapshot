# Scaling Overview for Services

This page provides a comprehensive overview of how each Sourcegraph service scales.
In order to support the growth of your instance usage, it is recommended to scale Sourcegraph based on the scaling factors suggested below.

Grafana should be the first stop you make if you plan to expand on one of the scaling factors or when you are experiencing a system performance issue. 

Please use the following scaling guideline for services that are using more than 80% of their assigned resources. 

Scaling is unnecessary if your resource usage is kept below 80%.

For example, if you plan to add 100% more engaged users, and the resource usage for all services is currently at around 70%, we’d recommend using this documentation as a reference to adjust the resources that list “Number of active users” as one of their scaling factors. You can also use the output from the Resource Estimator as references alternatively.

> NOTE: For assistance when scaling and tuning Sourcegraph, [contact us](https://about.sourcegraph.com/contact/). We're happy to help!

## Components Overview

Here is a list of components you can find in a typical Sourcegraph deployment:

### Core Components

|                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :-------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`frontend`](scale.md#frontend)                     | Serves the web application, extensions, and graphQL services. Almost every service has a link back to the frontend, from which it gathers configuration updates.                         |
| [`gitserver`](scale.md#gitserver)                   | Mirrors repositories from their code host. All other Sourcegraph services talk to gitserver when they need data from git.                                                                |
| [`precise-code-intel`](scale.md#precise-code-intel) | Converts LSIF upload file into Postgres data. The entire index must be read into memory to be correlated.                                                                                |
| [`repo-updater`](scale.md#repo-updater)             | Tracks the state of repositories. It is responsible for automatically scheduling updates using gitserver and for synchronizing metadata between code hosts and external services.        |
| [`searcher`](scale.md#searcher)                     | Provides on-demand unindexed search for repositories. It fetches archives from gitserver and searches them with regexp.                                                                  |
| [`symbols`](scale.md#symbols)                       | Indexes symbols in repositories using Ctags.                                                                                                                                             |
| [`syntect-server`](scale.md#syntect-server)         | An HTTP server that exposes the Rust Syntect syntax highlighting library for use by other services.                                                                                      |
| [`worker`](scale.md#worker)                         | Runs a collection of background jobs periodically in response to internal requests and external events. It is currently janitorial and commit based.                                     |
| [`zoekt-indexserver`](scale.md#zoekt-indexserver)   | Indexes all enabled repositories on Sourcegraph and keeps the indexes up to date. Lives inside the indexed-search pod in a Kubernetes deployment.                                        |
| [`zoekt-webserver`](scale.md#zoekt-webserver)       | Runs searches from indexes stored in memory and disk. The indexes are persisted to disk to avoid re-indexing on startup. Lives inside the indexed-search pod in a Kubernetes deployment. |

### External Services

## Scaling Guideline

> This section provides you with a high-level overview of how each Sourcegraph service works with resources, with a list of scaling factors and basic guideline. 

### cAdvisor

```
A cAdvisor instance.
It exports container monitoring metrics scraped by Prometheus and visualized in Grafana.
```

| Resources   |                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :---------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Overview`  | Scaling is not necessary as it is designed to be a small footprint service                                                                                                  |
| `Factors`   | Its primary traffic are the requests coming from Prometheus                                                                                                                 |

> WARNING: The database must be configured properly to consume resources effectively and efficiently for better performance and to avoid regular usage from overwhelming built-in utilities (like autovacuum for example). For example, a Postgres database running out of memory indicates that it is currently misconfigured and the amount of memory each worker can utilize should be reduced. See our [Postgres database configuration guide](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/config/postgres-conf) for more information.

> WARNING: The database must be configured properly to consume resources effectively and efficiently for better performance and to avoid regular usage from overwhelming built-in utilities (like autovacuum for example). For example, a Postgres database running out of memory indicates that it is currently misconfigured and the amount of memory each worker can utilize should be reduced. See our [Postgres database configuration guide](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/config/postgres-conf) for more information.

### repo-updater

```
Repo-updater tracks the state of repositories.
It is responsible for automatically scheduling updates using gitserver. 
It is also responsible for synchronizing metadata between code hosts and external services.
Services that desire updates or fetch must communicate with repo-updater instead of gitserver.
```

| `Guideline` | Requires enough disk space to store the largest repository                     |
|             | The most important thing is to ensure fast IO for storage                      |
|             | Add more disks or replicas if you have lots of unindexed searches              |

|             | The request size of the ephemeral storage is used as a limit for the zip cache |
|             | Non-persistent SSD for Docker Compose                                          |

> NOTE: For example, if you search all branches on all repositories, that translates into lots of concurrent unindexed requests.

### zoekt-indexserver

```
Indexes all enabled repositories on Sourcegraph.
It also keeps the indexes up to date.
Lives inside the indexed-search pod in a Kubernetes deployment.
The main guideline for scaling a zoekt-indexserver is the size of your largest repository.
```

> NOTE: As indexserver currently only indexes one repository at a time, having more CPU and memory are not as important here than in webserver.

| `Factors`   | Size of the largest repository                                                               |
| `Guideline` | More CPU results in lower lag between a new commit and the time it takes to index for search |

> WARNING: We recommend providing zoekt-indexserver with more resources when trying to add a lot of new repositories that requires indexing from a new external service, and then scale down once indexing is completed.

### zoekt-webserver

```
Runs searches from indexes stored in memory and disk.
It serves and processes data from zoekt-indexserver.
The indexes are persisted to disk to avoid re-indexing on startup.
Lives inside the indexed-search pod in a Kubernetes deployment.
```

> NOTE: Adding more CPU and memory helps speed up searches.
