# Updating a Docker Compose Sourcegraph instance

This document describes the exact changes needed to update a [Docker Compose Sourcegraph instance](../install/docker-compose.md).
Each section comprehensively describes the steps needed to upgrade, and any manual migration steps you must perform.

A new version of Sourcegraph is released every month (with patch releases in between, released as needed). Check the [Sourcegraph blog](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog) or the site admin updates page to learn about updates. We actively maintain the two most recent monthly releases of Sourcegraph.

> ⚠️ **Regardless of your deployment type:** ⚠️
> <br>Upgrade one version at a time, e.g. v3.26 --> v3.27 --> v3.28.
> <br>Patches, e.g. vX.X.4 vs. vX.X.5, do not have to be adopted when moving between vX.X versions.

> ⚠️ **Regardless of your deployment type:** ⚠️
> <br>Check your <a href="../migrations">out of band migration status</a> prior to upgrade to avoid a necessary rollback while the migration finishes.

**Always refer to this page before upgrading Sourcegraph,** as it comprehensively describes the steps needed to upgrade, and any manual migration steps you must perform.

<!-- GENERATE UPGRADE GUIDE ON RELEASE (release tooling uses this to add entries) -->

## 3.28 -> 3.29

TODO

*How smooth was this upgrade process for you? You can give us your feedback on this upgrade by filling out [this feedback form](https://share.hsforms.com/1aGeG7ALQQEGO6zyfauIiCA1n7ku?update_version=3.28).*
## Unreleased (notes for future releases not currently released)

This upgrade adds a new `worker` service that runs a number of background jobs that were previously run in the `frontend` service. See [notes on deploying workers](../workers.md#deploying-workers) for additional details. Good initial values for CPU and memory resources allocated to this new service should match the `frontend` service.

## 3.27 -> 3.28

TODO

*How smooth was this upgrade process for you? You can give us your feedback on this upgrade by filling out [this feedback form](https://share.hsforms.com/1aGeG7ALQQEGO6zyfauIiCA1n7ku?update_version=3.27).*

## Unreleased

- The memory requirements for `redis-cache` and `redis-store` have been increased by 1GB. See https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/pull/373 for more context.
## 3.26 -> 3.27

> Warning: ⚠️ Sourcegraph 3.27 now requires **Postgres 12+**.

If you are using an external database, [upgrade your database](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/postgres#upgrading-external-postgresql-instances) to Postgres 12 or above prior to upgrading Sourcegraph. No action is required if you are using the supplied supplied database images.

Afterwards, please upgrade to the [`v3.27.0` tag of deploy-sourcegraph-docker](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.27.0/docker-compose) by following the [standard upgrade procedure](#standard-upgrade-procedure).

*How smooth was this upgrade process for you? You can give us your feedback on this upgrade by filling out [this feedback form](https://share.hsforms.com/1aGeG7ALQQEGO6zyfauIiCA1n7ku?update_version=3.26).*

## 3.25 -> 3.26

No manual migration required.

Please upgrade to the [`v3.26.0` tag of deploy-sourcegraph-docker](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.26.0/docker-compose) by following the [standard upgrade procedure](#standard-upgrade-procedure).

> NOTE: ⚠️ From **3.27** onwards we will only support PostgreSQL versions **starting from 12**.

## 3.24 -> 3.25

- Go `1.15` introduced changes to SSL/TLS connection validation which requires certificates to include a `SAN`. This field was not included in older certificates and clients relied on the `CN` field. You might see an error like `x509: certificate relies on legacy Common Name field`. We recommend that customers using Sourcegraph with an external database and and connecting to it using SSL/TLS check whether the certificate is up to date.
    - AWS RDS customers please reference [AWS' documentation on updating the SSL/TLS certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html) for steps to rotate your certificate.

## 3.23 -> 3.24

Please upgrade to the [`v3.24.0` tag of deploy-sourcegraph-docker](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.24.0/docker-compose) by following the [standard upgrade procedure](#standard-upgrade-procedure).

## 3.22 -> 3.23

No manual migration required.

Please upgrade to the [`v3.23.0` tag of deploy-sourcegraph-docker](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.23.0/docker-compose) by following the [standard upgrade procedure](#standard-upgrade-procedure).

## 3.21 -> 3.22

No manual migration required.

Please upgrade to the [`v3.22.0` tag of deploy-sourcegraph-docker](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.22.0/docker-compose) by following the [standard upgrade procedure](#standard-upgrade-procedure).

This upgrade removes the `code intel bundle manager`. This service has been deprecated and all references to it have been removed.

This upgrade also adds a MinIO container that doesn't require any custom configuration. You can find more detailed documentation in https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/external_services/object_storage.

## 3.21.0 -> 3.21.1

No manual migration required.

Please upgrade to the [`v3.20.1` tag of deploy-sourcegraph-docker](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.20.1/docker-compose) by following the [standard upgrade procedure](#standard-upgrade-procedure).

## 3.20.1 -> 3.21.0

Please upgrade to the [`v3.21.0` tag of deploy-sourcegraph-docker](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.21.0/docker-compose) by following the [standard upgrade procedure](#standard-upgrade-procedure).

This release introduces a second database instance, `codeintel-db`. If you have configured Sourcegraph with an external database, then update the `CODEINTEL_PG*` environment variables to point to a new external database as described in the [external database documentation](../external_services/postgres.md). Again, these must not point to the same database or the Sourcegraph instance will refuse to start.

### If you wish to keep existing LSIF data

> Warning: **Do not upgrade out of the 3.21.x release branch** until you have seen the log message indicating the completion of the LSIF data migration, or verified that the `/lsif-storage/dbs` directory on the precise-code-intel-bundle-manager volume is empty. Otherwise, you risk data loss for precise code intelligence.

If you had LSIF data uploaded prior to upgrading to 3.21.0, there is a background migration that moves all existing LSIF data into the `codeintel-db` upon upgrade. Once this process completes, the `/lsif-storage/dbs` directory on the precise-code-intel-bundle-manager volume should be empty, and the bundle manager should print the following log message:

> Migration to Postgres has completed. All existing LSIF bundles have moved to the path /lsif-storage/db-backups and can be removed from the filesystem to reclaim space.

**Wait for the above message to be printed in `docker logs precise-code-intel-bundle-manager` before upgrading to the next Sourcegraph version**, then if everything is working you can free up disk space by deleting the backup bundle files using this command:

```sh
docker exec -it precise-code-intel-bundle-manager sh -c 'rm -rf /lsif-storage/db-backups'
```

## 3.19.2 -> 3.20.1

## (v3.14.2, v3.14.4) -> v3.15.1

No manual migration is required.

Please upgrade to the [`v3.15.1` tag of deploy-sourcegraph-docker](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.15.1/docker-compose) by following the [standard upgrade procedure](#standard-upgrade-procedure).

### (Optional) Keeping LSIF data

If your users have uploaded LSIF precise code intelligence data, you may keep it by running the following command after you have ran `docker-compose up` with the new v3.15.1 version:

```
docker run --rm -it -v /var/lib/docker:/docker alpine:latest sh -c 'cp -R /docker/volumes/docker-compose_lsif-server/_data/* /docker/volumes/docker-compose_precise-code-intel-bundle-manager/_data/'
```

Followed by:

```sh
docker run --rm -it -v /var/lib/docker:/docker alpine:latest sh -c 'chown -R 100:101 /docker/volumes/docker-compose_precise-code-intel-bundle-manager'
docker restart precise-code-intel-bundle-manager
```

## v3.14.2 -> v3.14.4

No manual migration is required.

Please upgrade to the [`v3.14.4` tag of deploy-sourcegraph-docker](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.14.4/docker-compose) by following the [standard upgrade procedure](#standard-upgrade-procedure).

## v3.14.0 -> v3.14.2

No manual migration is required.

Please upgrade to the [`v3.14.2` tag of deploy-sourcegraph-docker](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.14.2/docker-compose) by following the [standard upgrade procedure](#standard-upgrade-procedure).

## v3.13 -> 3.14

No manual migration is required.

Please be sure to upgrade to the [`v3.14.0-1` tag of deploy-sourcegraph-docker](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.14.0-1/docker-compose) by following the [standard upgrade procedure](#standard-upgrade-procedure).

If you have upgrade to `v3.14.0` already (not the `v3.14.0-1` version) and are experiencing restarts of lsif-server, please run the following on the host machine to correct it:

```sh
docker run --rm -it -v /var/lib/docker:/docker alpine:latest sh -c 'chown -R 100:101 /docker/volumes/docker-compose_lsif-server'
docker restart lsif-server
```

## v3.12 -> v3.13

A manual migration is required. Please follow the [standard upgrade procedure](#standard-upgrade-procedure) to take down the current deployment, perform the manual migration, and then upgrade using the [`v3.13.2` tag of deploy-sourcegraph-docker](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.13.2/docker-compose).

### Manual migration step: adjust file permissions

Please adjust the redis-store and redis-cache volume permissions by running the following on the host machine:

```
docker run --rm -it -v /var/lib/docker:/docker alpine:latest sh -c 'chown -R 999:1000 /docker/volumes/docker-compose_redis-store /docker/volumes/docker-compose_redis-cache'
```

### Standard upgrade procedure

In your fork of [the deploy-sourcegraph-docker](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker) repository, merge the new version into the `release` branch if you maintain any changes (see: [storing customizations in a fork](../install/docker-compose.md#optional-recommended-store-customizations-in-a-fork)):

```sh
cd docker-compose/
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream $NEW_VERSION
# Address any merge conflicts you may have.
```

Then on your server:

```sh
cd deploy-sourcegraph-docker/docker-compose/
docker-compose down --remove-orphans
git pull
docker-compose up -d
```
