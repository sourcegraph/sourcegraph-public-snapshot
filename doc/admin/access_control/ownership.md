# Access control for Ownership

Granular controls for who can assign [Ownership](../../own/index.md) can be configured by site admins by tuning the roles assigned to users and the permissions granted to those roles. This page describes the permission types available for Ownership, and whether they are granted by default to the **User** [system role](./index.md#system-roles). All permissions are granted to the **Site Administrator** system role by default.

Name      | Description | Granted to **User** by default?
--------- | ----------- | :-:
`ownerships:assign` | Assign ownership to users and teams on repository, directory and file levels | ✗
