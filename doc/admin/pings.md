# Pings

Sourcegraph periodically sends a ping to `pings.sourcegraph.com` to help our product and customer teams. It sends only the high-level data below. It never sends code, repository names, usernames, or any other specific data. To learn more, go to the **Site admin > Pings** page on your instance (the URL is `https://sourcegraph.example.com/site-admin/pings`). 

Sourcegraph will also periodically perform a license verification check, to verify the validity of the configured Sourcegraph license. Tampering with these checks, or preventing them from occuring, will cause Sourcegraph to disable many features until a successful check is completed. Certain Enterprise licenses can request to be exempt from these license verification checks.

## Allowlist IPs / CIDR Ranges for Sourcegraph

Starting 5.2.0:
- For `pings.sourcegraph.com`, allowlist the IP address: `34.36.231.254`
- For `sourcegraph.com`, allowlist the full [Cloudflare IP ranges](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/)

Prior to 5.2.0, allowlist the full [Cloudflare IP ranges](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/).

## Using an HTTP proxy for telemetry requests

The environment variable `TELEMETRY_HTTP_PROXY` can be set on the `sourcegraph-frontend` service, to use an HTTP proxy for telemetry requests.


Be sure to update the enviornment variable like so : ```TELEMETRY_HTTP_PROXY:"http://proxy.example.com:8080"```

## Connections to Sourcegraph-managed services


Sourcegraph only connects to Sourcegraph-managed services for three purposes:

1. The pings described above are sent, in order to:
   - Check for new product updates.
   - Send [anonymous, non-specific, aggregate metrics](#pings) back to Sourcegraph.com (see the full list above).
1. [Verify](./licensing/index.md) the validity of the configured Sourcegraph license.
1. Legacy Sourcegraph extensions are fetched from Sourcegraph.com`s extension registry.

There are no other automatic external connections to Sourcegraph.com (or any other site on the internet).

## Connections to Sourcegraph.com via Cody app

The Cody app connects to Sourcegraph.com to send a limited selection of the pings described above in order to infer value to our users and send update notifications. They include:  

- Randomly generated site identifier
- Deployment type (the Cody app)
- Release version
- Operating system
- Total number of repositories added
- Whether a user was active today (boolean) 

## Troubleshooting Pings

It may happen that Sourcegraph will stop sending critical telemetry to Sourcegraph.com, if this happens it may indicate a problem with Sourcegraphs frontend database, or a site settings misconfiguration. Below are some debugging steps.

Sourcegraph telemetry pings are handled by a goroutine running on Sourcegraphs frontend service called [`updatecheck`](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/blob/cmd/frontend/internal/app/updatecheck/client.go?subtree=true), `updatecheck` is [started](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24+file:%5Ecmd/frontend/internal/cli/serve_cmd%5C.go+updatecheck.Start%28db%29&patternType=literal) on container startup and periodically requests a variety of queries be run in the `pgsql` database.


### Misconfigured update.channel
The most common scenario in which Sourcegraph stops sending pings is a change to the `update.channel` setting in an instance's [site config](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/config/site_config)
```
"update.channel": "release",
```
*This setting [must be set to "release"](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/blob/internal/updatecheck/client.go?L803-806) in order for the telemetry goroutine to run.*


### Check if the goroutine is running

*This section is under development and currently only applies for docker-compose instances: [39710](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/39710)*

If it's reported that pings aren't being sent to the Sourcegraph.com, you can check that the goroutine is running with the following command:
```
docker exec -it sourcegraph-frontend-0 sh -c 'wget -nv -O- 'http://127.0.0.1:6060/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=1' | grep updatecheck'
```
Example:
```
[ec2-user@latveria-ip ~]$ docker exec -it sourcegraph-frontend-0 sh -c 'wget -nv -O- 'http://127.0.0.1:6060/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=1' | grep updatecheck'
2022-04-05 20:53:32 URL:http://127.0.0.1:6060/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=1 [14660] -> "-" [1]
#	0x1f052c5	github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/cmd/frontend/internal/app/updatecheck.Start+0xc5	github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/cmd/frontend/internal/app/updatecheck/client.go:697
```

### Looking for errors in the logs

If the `update.check` is running, and the site config is correctly configured, then it may be the case that `pgsql` is failing to return data from the SQL queries to the `frontend`. Check out the frontend logs for logs tagged [`telemetry: updatecheck failed`](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24+file:%5Ecmd/frontend/internal/app/updatecheck/client%5C.go+telemetry:+updatecheck+failed&patternType=literal).
