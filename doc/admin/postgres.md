# PostgreSQL

Sourcegraph uses several PostgreSQL databases to support various functionality. These databases are:

- pgsql or primary: responsible for user data and account information
- codeintel-db: provides support for lsif data and part of the code-intelligence

## Version requirements

We support any version **starting from 9.6**.

## Role requirements

The user provided to Sourcegraph must have full access to the `sg` database and be able to create the following
extensions:

```
citext
hstore
intarray
pg_stat_statements
pg_trgm
```

# Upgrading PostgreSQL

Sourcegraph uses PostgreSQL as its main internal database and this documentation describes how to upgrade PostgreSQL
between major versions.

> NOTE: ⚠️ Upgrading the PostgreSQL database requires stopping your Sourcegraph deployment which will result in **downtime**.

## Upgrading single node Docker deployments

> NOTE: If you running PostgreSQL externally, see [Upgrading external PostgreSQL instances](postgres.md#upgrading-external-postgresql-instances)

When running a new version of Sourcegraph, it will check if the PostgreSQL data needs upgrading upon initialization.

There are two ways that the PostgreSQL data can be updated:

- On start-up with access to the Docker socket.
- Running a script that uses the PostgreSQL upgrade container directly.

### Option 1. Upgrading on start-up using the Docker socket

<p class="container">
  <div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;">
    <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/315980428?color=0CB6F4&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>
</p>

**1.** Stop the `sourcegraph/server` container.

**2.** Add the volume mount code to your existing `docker run` command: `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro`.

See a complete example below:

```bash
# Add "--env=SRC_LOG_LEVEL=dbug" below for verbose logging.
docker run -p 7080:7080 -p 2633:2633 --rm \
  -v ~/.sourcegraph/config:/etc/sourcegraph \
  -v ~/.sourcegraph/data:/var/opt/sourcegraph \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
  sourcegraph/server:3.25.1
```

**3.** When the upgrade has been completed, stop the Sourcegraph container, then run again using the original `docker run` command (without mounting the Docker socket).

### Option 2. Upgrading with a script that uses the PostgreSQL upgrade container directly

<p class="container">
  <div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;">
    <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/315980439?color=0CB6F4&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>
</p>

You may need to manually upgrade the PostgreSQL data, e.g, if mounting the Docker socket isn't an option.

**1.** Stop the `sourcegraph/server` container.

**2.** Save this script and give it executable permissions (`chmod + x`).

> NOTE: The script presumes your data is being upgraded from `9.6` to `11` and your Sourcegraph directory is at `~/.sourcegraph/`. Change the values in the code below if that's not the case.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -xeuo pipefail

export OLD=${OLD:-"9.6"}
export NEW=${NEW:-"11"}
export SRC_DIR=${SRC_DIR:-"$HOME/.sourcegraph"}

docker run \
  -w /tmp/upgrade \
  -v "$SRC_DIR/data/postgres-$NEW-upgrade:/tmp/upgrade" \
  -v "$SRC_DIR/data/postgresql:/var/lib/postgresql/$OLD/data" \
  -v "$SRC_DIR/data/postgresql-$NEW:/var/lib/postgresql/$NEW/data" \
  "tianon/postgres-upgrade:$OLD-to-$NEW"

mv "$SRC_DIR/data/"{postgresql,postgresql-$OLD}
mv "$SRC_DIR/data/"{postgresql-$NEW,postgresql}

curl -fsSL -o "$SRC_DIR/data/postgres-$NEW-upgrade/optimize.sh" https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/master/cmd/server/rootfs/postgres-optimize.sh

docker run \
  --entrypoint "/bin/bash" \
  -w /tmp/upgrade \
  -v "$SRC_DIR/data/postgres-$NEW-upgrade:/tmp/upgrade" \
  -v "$SRC_DIR/data/postgresql:/var/lib/postgresql/data" \
  "postgres:$NEW" \
  -c 'chown -R postgres $PGDATA . && gosu postgres bash ./optimize.sh $PGDATA'
```

**3.** Execute the script.

**4.** Start the `sourcegraph/server` container.

## Upgrading Kubernetes PostgreSQL instances

The upgrade process is different for [Sourcegraph cluster deployments](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph) because [by default](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph/blob/7edcadbc3ebf46cb1bc1198f8a3e359a2380e22a/base/pgsql/pgsql.Deployment.yaml#L29), it uses `sourcegraph/postgres-11.1:19-02-07_17a4376e` which can be [customized with environment variables](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph/blob/7edcadb/docs/configure.md#configure-custom-postgresql).

If you have changed `PGUSER`, `PGDATABASE` or `PGDATA`, then the `PG*OLD` and `PG*NEW` environment variables are required. Below are the defaults and documentation on what each variable is used for:

- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=''`: Password of `PGUSERNEW` if it is newly created (i.e when `PGUSERNEW` didn't exist in the old database).
- `PGUSEROLD=sg`: A user that exists in the old database that can be used to authenticate intermediate upgrade operations.
- `PGUSERNEW=sg`: A user that must exist in the new database after the upgrade is done (i.e. it'll be created if it didn't exist already).
- `PGDATABASEOLD=sg`: A database that exists in the old database that can be used to authenticate intermediate upgrade operations. (e.g `psql -d`)
- `PGDATABASENEW=sg`: A database that must exist in the new database after the upgrade is done (i.e. it'll be created if it didn't exist already).
- `PGDATAOLD=/data/pgdata`: The data directory containing the files of the old PostgreSQL database to be upgraded.
- `PGDATANEW=/data/pgdata-11`: The data directory containing the upgraded PostgreSQL data files, used by the new version of PostgreSQL.

Additionally the upgrade process assumes it can write to the parent directory of `PGDATAOLD`.

## Upgrading external PostgreSQL instances

When running an external PostgreSQL instance, please do the following:

1. Back up the Postgres DB so that you can restore to the old version should anything go wrong.
2. Turn off Sourcegraph entirely (bring down all containers and pods so they cannot talk to Postgres.)
3. Upgrade Postgres to the latest version following your provider's instruction or your preferred method:
  - [AWS RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.PostgreSQL.html)
  - [AWS Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Upgrading.html)
  - [GCP CloudSQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/db-versions)
  - [Azure DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/concepts-supported-versions#managing-updates-and-upgrades)
  - [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/upgrading-heroku-postgres-databases)
  - [EnterpriseDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/en/9.6/pg/upgrading.html)
  - [Citus](http://docs.citusdata.com/en/v8.1/admin_guide/upgrading_citus.html)
  - [Aiven PostgreSQL](https://help.aiven.io/postgresql/operations/how-to-perform-a-postgresql-in-place-major-version-upgrade)
  - [Your own PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/pgupgrade.html)
4. Turn Sourcegraph back on connecting to the now-upgraded database.

> IMPORTANT: Do not allow Sourcegraph to run/connect to the new Postgres database until it has been fully populated with your data. Doing so could result in Sourcegraph trying to create e.g. a new DB schema and partially migrating. If this happens to you, restore from the backup you previously took or contact us (support@sourcegraph.com)
