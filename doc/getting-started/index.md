# Using Sourcegraph

Welcome to Sourcegraph!

## What is Sourcegraph?

Sourcegraph is a code search and intelligence tool for developers. It lets you search and explore all of your organization's code on the web, with integrations into your existing tools.

## What does Sourcegraph do?

Sourcegraph's main features are:

- [Code search](#code-search): fast, up-to-date, and scalable, with regexp support on any branch or commit without an indexing delay (and diff search)
- [Code navigation](#code-navigation): jump-to-definition, find references, and other smart, IDE-like code browsing features on any branch, commit, or PR/code review
- [Code Insights](../code_insights/index.md): reveal high-level information about your codebase at it's current state and over time, to track migrations, version usage, vulnerability remediation, ownership, and anything else you can search in Sourcegraph
- [Batch Changes](../batch_changes/index.md): make large-scale code changes across many repositories and code hosts
- [Notebooks](../notebooks/index.md): pair code and markdown to create powerful live–and persistent–documentation
- Easy and secure self-hosted installation (your code never touches our servers)
- [Integrations](#integrations) with code hosts, code review tools, editors, web browsers, etc.

## What do I use Sourcegraph for?

Sourcegraph helps you:

- Find example code
- Explore/read code (including during a code review)
- Debug issues
- Locate a specific piece of code
- Determine the impact of changes

Sourcegraph makes it faster and easier to perform these tasks, for you and everyone else at your organization.

## Who should use Sourcegraph?

All developers, except:

- Sourcegraph is more useful to developers working with larger codebases or teams (15+ developers).
- If you rarely search, read, or review code, you probably won't find Sourcegraph useful. (But you should start reading and reviewing more code!)

## Who else uses Sourcegraph?

In addition to the [companies listed on about.sourcegraph.com](https://about.sourcegraph.com), many large technology companies with 500-15,000+ engineers use Sourcegraph internally.

Also, both Facebook and Google provide an in-house Sourcegraph-like code search and intelligence tool to their employees. A [published research paper from Google](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43835.pdf) and a [Google developer survey](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LQxLk4E3lrb3fIsVKlANu_pUjnILteoWMMNiJQmqNVU/edit#heading=h.xxziwxixfqq3) showed that 98% of developers surveyed consider their Sourcegraph-like internal tool to be critical. Developers use it on average for 5.3 sessions each day. (Facebook's and Google's in-house tools are not available to other companies; use Sourcegraph instead.)

## How do I start using Sourcegraph?

1. [Deploy and Configure Sourcegraph](../admin/deploy/index.md) inside your organization on your internal code, if nobody else has yet
1. Install and configure the [web browser code host integrations](../integration/browser_extension.md) (recommended)
1. Start searching and browsing code on Sourcegraph by visiting the URL of your organization's internal Sourcegraph instance
1. [Personalize Sourcegraph](personalization/index.md) with themes, quick links, and badges!

You can also try [Sourcegraph.com](https://sourcegraph.com/search), which is a public instance of Sourcegraph for use on open-source code only.

## Code navigation

Sourcegraph gives your development team cross-repository IDE-like features on your code:

- Hover tooltips
- Go-to-definition
- Find references
- Symbol search

Sourcegraph gives you code navigation in:

- **code files in Sourcegraph's web UI**

![Hover tooltip](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/code-graph/docs/hover-tooltip.png)

- **diffs in your code review tool**, via [integrations](../integration/index.md)

![GitHub pull request integration](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/code-graph/docs/github-pr.png)

- **code files on your code host**, via [integrations](../integration/index.md)

![GitHub file integration](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/code-graph/docs/github-file.png)

Read the [code navigation documentation](../code_navigation/index.md) to learn more and to set it up.

## Code search

Sourcegraph code search is fast, works across all your repositories at any commit, and has no indexing delay. Code search also includes advanced features, including:

- Powerful, flexible query syntax
- Commit diff search
- Commit message search
- Custom search scopes
- Saved search monitoring

Read the [code search documentation](../code_search/index.md) to learn more and discover the full feature set.

## Integrations

Sourcegraph allows you to get code navigation and code search on code files and code review diffs in your code host and review tool. See our [integrations documentation](../integration/index.md) to set up Sourcegraph with your tools and roll it out to your entire team.
