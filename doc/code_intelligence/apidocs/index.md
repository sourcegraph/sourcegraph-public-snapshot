# API docs for your code

<p class="subtitle">API documentation generated for all your code</p>

<p class="lead">
Sourcegraph uses <a href="../">LSIF code intelligence</a> to generate API documentation for all your code, giving you the ability to navigate and explore the APIs provided by repositories.
</p>

## 🚀 Try it out

You can try out API docs on Sourcegraph.com here:

* [sourcegraph.com/github.com/golang/go](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/golang/go/-/docs)
* [sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/docs)

## ✨ Try API docs on your repository

Tweet us your Go repository name to @slimsag @sourcegraph and we'll index and upload LSIF data for you, so you can try API docs on your repository! 🎉 -- or [do it yourself](../index.md).

## ⚠️ Experimental status

API docs is an experimental feature of Sourcegraph. If you like this idea, have any feedback, please reach out:

* (lead engineer) twitter:@slimsag stephen@sourcegraph.com
* (entire team) twitter:@sourcegraph support@sourcegraph.com

We're working hard to improve it rapidly, so your feedback will influence the future direction a lot!
