# Search-based code intelligence

Sourcegraph comes with built-in code intelligence provided by search-based heuristics.

If you are interested in enabling precise code intelligence for your repository, see our [quickstart guide](../lsif_quickstart.md).

## How does it work?

[Search-based code intelligence](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph-basic-code-intel) is able to provide 3 core code intelligence features:

- Jump to definition: it performs a [symbol search](../../code_search/explanations/features.md#symbol-search)
- Hover documentation: it first finds the definition then extracts documentation from comments near the definition
- Find references: it performs a case-sensitive word-boundary cross-repository [plain text search](../../code_search/explanations/features.md#powerful-flexible-queries) for the given symbol

Search-based code intelligence also filters results by file extension and by imports at the top of the file for some languages.

## What languages are supported?

Search-based code intelligence supports all of [the most popular programming languages](https://sourcegraph.com/extensions?query=category%3A%22Programming+languages%22).

Are you using a language we don't support? [File a GitHub issue](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/new/choose) or [submit a PR](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph-basic-code-intel#adding-a-new-sourcegraphsourcegraph-lang-extension).

## Why are my results sometimes incorrect?

Search-based code intelligence uses search-based heuristics, rather than parsing the code into an [abstract syntax tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) (AST). Incorrect results occur more often for tokens with common names (such as `Get`) than for tokens with more unique names simply because those tokens appear more often in the search index.

If you require 100% confidence in accuracy for a definition or reference results for a symbol you hovered over we recommend utilizing precise code intelligence. Scenarios where you may still get search-based code intelligence results even with precision on are described in more detail in the [precise code intelligence docs](./precise_code_intelligence.md).
