    - All information presented must accessible in written form from the [product roadmap](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/team/roadmap). If it's important enough to be presented at team meeting, it's important enough to be written down. (It doesn't need to be perfectly spec'd---it's OK if it's written down in a file on a branch, in draft form, etc.)
    - Each row in the current month's product roadmap table is presented by the team members listed, in the same order (top to bottom) as the table.
    - When deciding what to say about your work, consider the following.
      - What is the goal of the project? What problem does it solve?
      - Who is the intended target user of the project?
      - Has the plan changed? Why?
      - What might be interesting/surprising/exciting to the team about the project?
      - Is there a risk of not shipping as planned (features or schedule)?
      - If there's nothing valuable to say about the project, or if you can't answer these questions, talk with @sqs ASAP.

    - Also share these announcements in team chat in #general.
