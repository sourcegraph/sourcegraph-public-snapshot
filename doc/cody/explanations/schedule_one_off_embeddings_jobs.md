# Schedule one-off embeddings jobs

Adminstrators can schedule one-off embeddings jobs from the _Site Admin_ page. Open the _Site Admin_ page and select **Cody > Embeddings Jobs** from the left-hand navigation menu.

At the top of the page select the input field and search for the repository you want to index. Multiple repositories can be selected. Once you have selected the repositories, click on **Schedule Embedding**. The new jobs will be shown in the list of jobs below. The initial status of the jobs will be _queued_.
