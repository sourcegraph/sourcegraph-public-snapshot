# Commands

<p class="subtitle">Learn how Commands can kick-start your workflow with reusable prompts.</p>

Cody offers quick, ready-to-use **commands** for common actions to write, describe, fix, and smell code. These allow you to run predefined actions with smart context-fetching anywhere in the editor. Like autocomplete and chat, commands will search for context in your codebase to provide more contextually aware and informed answers.

Commands are available in VS Code, JetBrains, and the Sourcegraph web app. Commands can handle tasks like:

- Editing and fixing code (`edit`)
- Explaining code (`explain`)
- Generating unit tests (`test`)
- Writing documentation (`doc`)
- Improving code quality (`smell`)

Support for commands may vary by IDE extension. Read the [feature parity reference to learn what commands are available in your IDE](./../feature-reference.md#commands).

> NOTE: Cody’s responses to commands are often better than responses to chats since they’ve been pre-packaged and prompt-engineered.

## Running commands

The process of running a command varies from one IDE to another. For example, in VS Code, there several ways to run a command:

1. Highlight your code and select the command from the sidebar

![running-commands](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/Docs/using-commands.png)

2. Open up the command palette with `Option+C` `Alt+C`
3. Right-click on any code element and select **Cody > Choose a command** from the list
4. Type `/` in the chat bar. Cody will then suggest a list of available commands

To access it, navigate to the `Commands` panel (next to the `Chat` panel), and you can find each available command as a button within the UI.

**Custom Commands** allow you to create and define reusable prompts for Cody tailored to your development workflows. They are defined in `JSON` format and will enable you to call CLI tools, write custom prompts, and select context to be sent to Cody. This provides a flexible way to configure Cody to handle use cases like:

- Integrate with your build system to suggest fixes for errors/warnings in the latest build
- Analyze software dependencies output to explain compatibility or suggest upgrades
- Read test command failures to explain and suggest fixes
- Explain code quality output like linter warnings

> NOTE: Cody supports Custom Commands only for VS Code version 0.8 and above.

### Creating a Custom Command

You can create a custom command by editing the configuration JSON file or using the command builder within the VS Code editor. To access the command builder within VS Code:

- Open the Cody commands menu (`⌥C` on Mac or `Alt-C` on Windows/Linux)
- Select **Custom commands > New Custom Command**
- Type the slash `/` name you want to use, for example, `/my-custom-command`
- Next, write a suitable description for the command in sentence case. For example, `Compare files in open tabs` or `Explain current directory`
- Provide the relevant instructions for Cody to follow. This is the `prompt` that Cody will use to pass relevant context to the LLM
- Then, select one or more options for the context Cody should use to generate responses
- Finally, choose whether to save the command locally or share it with your workspace
- Press **Enter** to complete the process, and your custom command is successfully created
- You can hit `esc` key at any time to discard a new custom command

### Running Custom Commands

You can invoke custom commands with the same hotkey as predefined commands. Once created, your custom commands will appear with the rest of the predefined commands in the chat and command palette lists. Let's type `/my-custom-command` in the chat window, and it will appear. Now, you can run this new command on your code and get answers to your questions accordingly.

![create-new-custom-command](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/Docs/custom-command.png)

Alternatively, you can right-click the selected code and select **Cody > Custom Commands**.

### Configuring file paths

Custom Commands can be defined in the following two file paths:

- **User Settings (`~/.vscode/code.json`)**: Stored locally. Use this for personal commands to use across all your projects
- **Workspace Settings (`.vscode/cody.json`)**: Stored in your project’s repository. Use this to share commands with others working on the same codebase and for project-specific commands

If you select **User Settings**, the new custom command will only be available to you. If you select **Workspace Settings** (as an enterprise user), the custom command will also be available to your teammates.

See the [examples](#examples) and [configuration properties](#configuration-properties) below for more details on configuring custom commands.

### Examples

### `/commit-message`

```json
{
  "commit-message": {
    "description": "Commit message for current changes",
    "prompt": "Suggest an informative commit message by summarizing code changes from the shared command output. The commit message should follow the conventional commit format and provide meaningful context for future readers.",

      "command": "git diff --cached"
    }
  }
}
```

### `/compare-tabs`

```json
{
  "compare-tabs": {
    "description": "Compare files in opened tabs",
    "prompt": "Examine the shared code snippets from my opened tabs. Then explain the relationship between the code samples by answering these questions: 1. What are the main tasks or functions the code is performing? 2. Are there any similarities in functions or logic across the samples? 3. Does one code snippet call or import another? If so, how do they interact? 4. Are there any notable differences in how they approach similar problems? 5. Overall, how are the code snippets related - do they work together as part of a larger program, solve variants of the same problem, or serve entirely different purposes?",
    "context": {
      "openTabs": true,
      "selection": false
    }
  }

    "context": {
      "selection": false,
      "command": "curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sourcegraph/cody/main/vscode/CHANGELOG.md | head -n 50"

```

### `/readme`

```json
{
  "readme": {
    "description": "Readme for current dir",
    "prompt": "Write a detailed README.md file to document the code located in the same directory as my current selection. Summarize what the code in this directory is meant to accomplish. Explain the key files, functions, classes, and features. Use Markdown formatting for headings, code blocks, lists, etc. to make the it organized and readable. Aim for a beginner-friendly explanation that gives a developer unfamiliar with the code a good starting point to understand it. Make sure to include: - Overview of directory purpose - Functionality explanations - Relevant diagrams or visuals if helpful. Write the README content clearly and concisely using complete sentences and paragraphs based on the shared context. Use proper spelling, grammar, and punctuation throughout. Surround your full README text with triple backticks so it renders properly as a code block. Do not make assumptions or fabricating additional details.",
    "context": {
      "currentDir": true,
      "selection": true
    }
  }
}
```

<!-- ### Defining commands in the `cody.json` file

You can define custom commands for Cody in the `cody.json` file. To make commands only available for a specific project, create the `cody.json` file in that project's `.vscode` directory. When you work on that project, these workspace-specific custom commands will be available.

To make custom commands globally available across multiple projects, create a new `cody.json` file in your home directory's `.vscode` folder. These global custom commands will be available in Cody in any workspace. -->
