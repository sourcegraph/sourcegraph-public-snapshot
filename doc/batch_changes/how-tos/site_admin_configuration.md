# Site admin configuration for Batch Changes

Using Batch Changes requires a [code host connection](../../../admin/external_service/index.md) to a supported code host (currently GitHub, Bitbucket Server, and GitLab).

Site admins can also:

- [Configure repository permissions](../../../admin/repo/permissions.md), which Batch Changes will respect.
- [Disable Batch Changes](../explanations/permissions_in_batch_changes.md#disabling-batch-changes).
- [Disable Batch Changes for non-site-admin users](../explanations/permissions_in_batch_changes.md#disabling-batch-changes-for-non-site-admin-users).
