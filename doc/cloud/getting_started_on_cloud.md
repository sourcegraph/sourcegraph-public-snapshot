# Getting Started on Sourcegraph Cloud for Individuals

Are you new to Sourcegraph Cloud? This is your place to start. 

[Sourcegraph Cloud](https://sourcegraph.com/search) lets you search across your personal code from GitHub.com or GitLab.com, and across more than 2 million open source repositories. Sourcegraph Cloud allows any individual to sign up, connect personal repositories, and search across personal code for free. 

## Getting Started
Getting started with Sourcegraph Cloud takes less than one minute. Follow the below steps to get started
1. Sign up for an [account on Sourcegraph Cloud](https://sourcegraph.com/sign-up). After sign-up, you will be guided through the next two steps
2. Connect a code host using your OAuth flow. Sourcegraph Cloud natively supports Github.com and Gitlab.com repositories. 
3. Next, [add your repositories to Sourcegraph](https://learn.sourcegraph.com/how-to-add-private-code-repositories-to-sourcegraph). Sourcegraph respects code host permissions, so you should only see repositories which you have permission to view on the code host you connected.
