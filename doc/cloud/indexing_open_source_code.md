# Indexing the OSS universe

Sourcegraph is on a mission to [make coding more accessible to the world](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/company/strategy).

In order to execute this mission, Sourcegraph has committed to indexing open source repositories from various code hosts including GitLab and GitHub. By indexing these repositories, Sourcegraph allows any engineer to tap into the knowledge of the open source universe near-instantaneously. You can read more about our decision to do this [here](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/indexing-the-oss-universe-update-more-code-hosts/).

Sourcegraph's open source code index presently includes more than 2 million repositories, and searching these open source repositories is available for free on [Sourcegraph Cloud](https://sourcegraph.com/). 

## Opting out

We believe that having the universe of open source code available all in one place will prove to be an asset for many developers; however, we also understand that this may raise concerns among open source contributors. While we do not offer the ability to opt out of our open source code index today, it is something that we have heard requested from the community. Our teams are exploring solutions and are eager to partner with the larger community on how we implement an opt-out. This section will be updated as soon as we have more information to provide, but in the meantime, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at [feedback@sourcegraph.com](mailto:feedback@sourcegraph.com).
