# Secure

> This Secure product direction page is maintained by Quinn Slack ([sqs@sourcegraph.com](mailto:sqs@sourcegraph.com)). Please share feedback by email, [in an issue](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/new), or on a [video call](https://calendly.com/sqs/20-minute-product-chat).

## Overview

Sourcegraph improves and enforces security across your entire codebase in a consistent, developer-friendly way. Our customers accomplish this by using [code search](../../user/search/index.md), [saved searches](../../user/search/saved_searches.md), and the [Sourcegraph API](../../api/graphql/index.md).

In the future, Sourcegraph will provide more security and compliance features:

- With [automation](../automate/index.md), you will be able to create large-scale campaigns across your entire codebase to fix critical security or compliance issues, and track follow-through to completion.
- With the [Sourcegraph extension API](../../extensions/index.md) and editor integration, you will be able to give immediate feedback to developers in their editor and in pre-commit hooks about security or compliance issues. This saves time and significantly increases developers' tolerance of these efforts.

Sourcegraph will integrate with existing open-source and commercial tools to detect and fix these issues in code. The value of Sourcegraph is that it runs these kinds of tools across your entire codebase, creating and tracking hundreds or thousands of issues or pull requests--all grouped according to project structure, assigned to the correct person, and prioritized according to triage criteria based on usage, dependency tree information, and other information computed using Sourcegraph's understanding of your code structure.
