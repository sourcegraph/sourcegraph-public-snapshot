/**
 * Composites are layed out in the sidebar and panel part of the workbench. At a time only one composite
 * can be open in the sidebar, and only one composite can be open in the panel.
 * Each composite has a minimized representation that is good enough to provide some
 * information about the state of the composite data.
 * The workbench will keep a composite alive after it has been created and show/hide it based on
 * user interaction. The lifecycle of a composite goes in the order create(), setVisible(true|false),
 * layout(), focus(), dispose(). During use of the workbench, a composite will often receive a setVisible,
 * layout and focus call, but only one create and dispose call.
