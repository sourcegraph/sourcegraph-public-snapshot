 * Welcome to the monaco builder. The recommended way to use it is:
 *
 * import Builder = require('vs/base/browser/builder');
 * let $ = Builder.$;
 * $(....).fn(...);
 *
 * See below for examples how to invoke the $():
 *
 * 	$()							- creates an offdom builder
 * 	$(builder)					- wraps the given builder
 * 	$(builder[])				- wraps the given builders into a multibuilder
 * 	$('div')					- creates a div
 * 	$('.big')					- creates a div with class `big`
 * 	$('#head')					- creates a div with id `head`
 * 	$('ul#head')				- creates an unordered list with id `head`
 * 	$('<a href="back"></a>')	- constructs a builder from the given HTML
 * 	$('a', { href: 'back'})		- constructs a builder, similarly to the Builder#element() call
