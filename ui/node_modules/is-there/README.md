> Check if a file or directory exists in a given path.

## Why? `fs.exists` already does the job!

Because `fs.exists` and `fs.existsSync` ~~will be~~ are deprecated and in some cases we still need them!

> `fs.exists()` is an anachronism and exists only for historical reasons. There should almost never be a reason to use it in your own code.
> In particular, checking if a file exists before opening it is an anti-pattern that leaves you vulnerable to race conditions: another process may remove the file between the calls to `fs.exists()` and `fs.open()`. Just open the file and handle the error when it's not there.
> **`fs.exists()` will be deprecated.**

});


console.log("> Testing async method.");
