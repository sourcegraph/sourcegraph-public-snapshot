/**
 * A React hook that scrolls the viewport to the element identified in the location hash (e.g., the
 * element with ID or name "foo" for the URL "https://example.com/a/b/#foo").
 *
 * This is needed because the browser's standard scroll-to-hash behavior doesn't work when using
 * react-router.
 *
 * If a React component needs the browser to scroll to elements that it renders asynchronously, the
 * React component must use this hook in such a way that it is invoked on each render. It is OK if
 * multiple components in a render tree use this hook.
