# Branded

This folder contains client code that is **branded**, i.e. it implements the visual design language we use across our web app and e.g. in the options menu of the browser extension.
Code here can use global classes and must not adapt styles of the code host (for more details, see [Styling UI in the handbook](../../doc/dev/background-information/web/styling.md)).

Any code that is code host agnostic should go into [`../shared`](../shared) instead.
