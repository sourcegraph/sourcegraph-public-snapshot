Sourcegraph, Inc.
Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement")
https://sourcegraph.com

Thank you for your interest in Sourcegraph, Inc. ("Sourcegraph"). In
order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with
Contributions from any person or entity, Sourcegraph must have a
Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") on file that has been signed by
each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms
below. This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as
the protection of Sourcegraph and its users; it does not change your
rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

This Agreement allows an entity (the "Corporation") to submit
Contributions to Sourcegraph, to authorize Contributions submitted by
its designated employees to Sourcegraph, and to grant copyright and
patent licenses thereto.

If you have not already done so, please complete and sign, then scan
and email a PDF file of this Agreement to support@sourcegraph.com. If
necessary, send an original signed Agreement to Sourcegraph, Inc. 121
2nd St Ste 200, San Francisco, CA 94105, U.S.A. Please read this
document carefully before signing and keep a copy for your records.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your
present and future Contributions submitted to Sourcegraph. Except for
the license granted herein to Sourcegraph and recipients of software
distributed by Sourcegraph, You reserve all right, title, and interest
in and to Your Contributions.

1. Definitions.

"You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity
authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with
Sourcegraph. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and
all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under
common control with that entity are considered to be a single
Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i)
the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of
such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of
fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii)
beneficial ownership of such entity.

"Contribution" shall mean the code, documentation or other original
works of authorship expressly identified in Schedule B, as well as any
original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions
to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to
Sourcegraph for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products
owned or managed by the Foundation (the "Work"). For the purposes of
this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or
written communication sent to Sourcegraph or its representatives,
including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing
lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that
are managed by, or on behalf of, Sourcegraph for the purpose of
discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is
conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not
a Contribution."

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, You hereby grant to Sourcegraph and to recipients of
software distributed by Sourcegraph a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license
to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such
derivative works.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, You hereby grant to Sourcegraph and to recipients of
software distributed by Sourcegraph a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated
in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to
sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such
license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are
necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination
of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s)
were submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You
or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit) alleging that Your Contribution, or the Work to which You
have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent
infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under
this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the
date such litigation is filed.

4. You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above
license.  If You are an individual, if Your employer(s) has rights to
intellectual property that You create that includes Your
Contributions, You represent that You have received permission to make
Contributions on behalf of that employer, that Your employer has
waived such rights for Your Contributions to Sourcegraph, or that Your
employer has executed a separate CLA with Sourcegraph. If You are a
legal entity, You represent further that each employee of the
Corporation designated on Schedule A below (or in a subsequent written
modification to that Schedule) is authorized to submit Contributions
on behalf of the Corporation.

5. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original
creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others).

6. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions,
except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide
support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by
applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions
on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
either express or implied, including, without limitation, any
warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY,
or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

7. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation,
You may submit it to the Foundation separately from any Contribution,
identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or
other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents,
trademarks, and license agreements) of which You are personally aware,
and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a
third-party: [named here]".

8. You agree to notify Sourcegraph of any facts or circumstances of
which You become aware that would make these representations
inaccurate in any respect.  If You are a legal entity, it is Your
responsibility to notify Sourcegraph when any change is required to
the list of designated employees authorized to submit Contributions on
behalf of the Corporation, or to the Corporation's Point of Contact
with Sourcegraph.
