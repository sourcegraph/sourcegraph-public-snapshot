// CachedLocationResolver resolves repositories, commits, and git tree entries and caches the resulting
// resolvers so that the same request does not re-resolve the same repository, commit, or path multiple
// times during execution. This cache reduces the number duplicate of database and gitserver queries for
// definition, reference, and diagnostic queries, which return collections of results that often refer
// to a small set of repositories, commits, and paths with a large multiplicity.
//
// This resolver maintains a hierarchy of caches as a way to decrease lock contention. Resolution of a
// repository holds the top-level lock. Resolution of a commit holds a lock associated with the parent
// repository. Similarly, resolution of a path holds a lock associated with the parent commit.
