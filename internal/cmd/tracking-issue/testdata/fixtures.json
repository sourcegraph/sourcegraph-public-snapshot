Questions:\r\n\r\nQuestions for @sourcegraph/core-services :\r\n\r\n1. How hard would it be for us to make `read:org` permissions dependent upon whether the `allowOrgs` property is set, or whether or not GHE is in use, or something like that? (i.e. opt-in)\r\n2. Assuming it is possible and there aren't implications I am not thinking of, can we commit to doing this in a specific release (so I can let them know)?\r\n\r\nNote: I think this type of permission opt-in would generally be beneficial as we require new code host permissions in the future, as we have seen this be a mild hurdle within some organizations where changes in permissions like this require sign off from different teams, etc. I am proposing this not for a specific customer but rather because it would be beneficial for most, I believe.\r\n\r\n",

    "Body": "Right now we don't support updating a Campaign's changesets when they've\nonly been partially published. We have an explicit check in the code\nthat makes sure to only update changesets if the Campaign has been\npublished.\n\nBut that means that we don't support the following scenario:\n\n1. Create Campaign with 10 changesets *in draft mode*\n2. Publish 2 of 10 changesets, creating them on code hosts\n3. Update Campaign to change name, description or arguments (`scopeQuery`, `matchTemplate`, ...)\n4. 2 already-published changesets are updated/closed on code hosts.\n\nSupporting this is not trivial, since we'd effectively need to detect\nwhether we're in this subset-published mode and depending on that, do a\ndifferent update than we'd do otherwise.\n\n#### Option A\n\nIn the normal update path (all or no changesets are published), we create \"missing changesets\" on codehosts that haven't been created before.\n\nBut in this new subset-update path (where only subset of changesets is published), we haven't created `ChangesetJobs` for all repositories yet, so we shouldn't create those now.\n\nInstead, we should _only_ update the Changesets that have already been published, but _only_ if the updated Campaign would create them again.\n\nIf the updated Campaign would _not_ create them again, we'd need to close them.\n\n#### Option B\n\nAnother possibility: when you update a Campaign, all already-published changesets are closed by default and only recreated/updated when you re-publish them individually or publish the whole Campaign.",

Single email could be used for registering multiple Accounts by only changing username\r\n2. No rate limit on following endpoint could lead to spamming of anyone's inbox using SourceGraph platform.\r\n\r\nVulnerable Endpoint:\r\nPOST /-/sign-up HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: sourcegraph.com\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Go to https://sourcegraph.com/sign-up\r\n2. Enter victim's email (to whom you want to spam), username and password\r\n3. Click Signup, intercept request in burp and send to intruder\r\n4. Select username as attack position, load a huge list of unique username (like Single text with incremental numbers)\r\n5. Start Attack.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nI tried with approx 50 different usernames like Faraz1, Faraz2, Faraz3 etc... and It sent a confirmation email to same email address every time.\r\n\r\nPoC:\r\n\r\n![SourceGraph_RateLimit_Gmail](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/754768/72648205-55907c80-392f-11ea-985e-5949556a8195.png)\r\n![SourceGraph_RateLimit_Intruder](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/754768/72648211-59240380-392f-11ea-9009-f8bef9447e15.png)\r\n\r\nImpact:\r\n\r\n1. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to spam anyone's inbox using SourceGraph Platform.\r\n2. Sending millions of emails in a short period of time could result in performance degradation of mail server, which may result in denying of service to legit users.\r\n3. Overloading SourceGraph mail server.\r\n\r\n\r\nMitigation:\r\nA simple solution could be to apply rate limiting to this request as well as single account should be allowed to register with an email address, as seen suitable by SourceGraph Team.",

    "Title": "Automation should never miss search results",
    "Body": "In its current state Automation campaigns might miss search results because of the way it interacts with our search infrastructure. See [this comment chain](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/7790#discussion_r367736633) for the full context. Below are a few excerpts\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@rvantonder in https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/7790#discussion_r367736633:\r\n\r\n\u003e Here's a breakdown of things:\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e - for the repo question: this  (to me) is a problem where we don't have the possibility of two things at the same time: (1) a clean way to operate on a repo given we know what the repo is already and (2) a filtering mechanism to only run on certain files, or with certain constraints. The nice thing about replacer is that it actually solves (1) as far as the API is concerned: just give it the repo, it'll do the fetching, and it'll run comby on all the files (there is a way to filter files, but it is not _exactly_ the same as what we support in the query). But the point is there's no danger of fiddling with queries/escaping. The problem: the replacer interface is too rudimentary to understand/implement the full spectrum of our search query. The frontend/search interface (2) _does_ understand the full query and can perform the filtering mechanism (useful!) but the problem is that we need to mess around with the query to do that properly. I agree this is the best possible option right now, but there is another danger hidden in (2). Next point.\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e - Any time we ever call `newSearch`, we are never guaranteed to find all matches. For search/replace, it is imperative that we (a) always try our hardest to replace every instance (i.e., we will wait!) or (b) if we don't get everything, we need to know about what was missed. It would be great if there was a knob to say 'search and replace this, just guarantee me that you found every single instance', but there is a ton of search functionality across concerns (index/searcher/...) that make adding such a knob very very hard IMO, and it would be easier to build such a \"guaranteed searcher\" 'from scratch in replacer than try layer it onto search. The alternative is that we are cognizant of the limitations of search and monitor it when it tells us 'there were more results, but I didn't return them'. If we go this route, we will need to add a lot of (TBH probably annoying) logic that checks the state of returned results, refetches, and all that. I'm not even sure how we can guarantee that pans out, since search can skip repos _or_ files. It is brittle for this purpose brittle. Pagination gives me some hope that we can do finer accounting and do 'retry' operations in a much easier way (right now we'd have to do the accounting ourselves, somehow).\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e So we have bigger problems than that repo issue. Just for this regex campaign mode, I realized that since this is using searcher, partial results will return quickly, and so I basically will add `count:10000` with no real guarantee that all of the matches are covered. \r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e For example, when I create these campaigns locally:\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e ```\r\n\u003e {\r\n\u003e     \"scopeQuery\": \"repo:github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph file:.*\",\r\n\u003e     \"regexMatch\": \"func\",\r\n\u003e     \"textReplace\": \"foo\"\r\n\u003e }\r\n\u003e ```\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e will have 1048 matches (and returns quickly) while\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e ```\r\n\u003e {\r\n\u003e     \"scopeQuery\": \"repo:github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph file:.* count:10000\",\r\n\u003e     \"regexMatch\": \"func\",\r\n\u003e     \"textReplace\": \"foo\"\r\n\u003e }\r\n\u003e ```\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e will have 10647.\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e But there's an even bigger problem than the number of matches getting cut off by `count` or `timer`: it is that when we filter using, e.g., `file`, the list of files can _also_ be cut off. So for example, the query\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e ```\r\n\u003e {\r\n\u003e     \"scopeQuery\": \"repo:github.com/torvalds/linux index:no file:.* count:10000\",\r\n\u003e     \"regexMatch\": \"TODO\",\r\n\u003e     \"textReplace\": \"DONE\"\r\n\u003e }\r\n\u003e ```\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e on my machine will return only 15 matches. That's because we return some number of files (I think 1000 and `count` doesn't appear to do anything) and there are only 15 matches in those files. If I want to force search to try harder, I actually have to use the `regexMatch` value in the `scopeQuery`:\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e ```\r\n\u003e {\r\n\u003e     \"scopeQuery\": \"repo:github.com/torvalds/linux TODO index:no file:.* count:10000\",\r\n\u003e     \"regexMatch\": \"TODO\",\r\n\u003e     \"textReplace\": \"yo\"\r\n\u003e }\r\n\u003e ```\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e This finds 1776 matches. Does this find all the matches? _I still don't know_ and that's the problem. Long term we'll have to think about how to either rearchitect search code or queries to handle this issue, or build up a dedicated replacer service. There's contention in designing for 'time-to-first-result' and 'match-and-replace-all-instances-at-almost-any-cost'.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@rvantonder in https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/7790#discussion_r367868835:\r\n\r\n\u003e To be clear, what I mean is that we need to do (possibly significant) extra work compared to what the current search code is geared towards, not that it's at odds.\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e @keegancsmith probably has better insight, but my gut reaction is that using indexed search results/Zoekt is a no go. It is a black box and takes lots of shortcuts in ways that's hard to guarantee that it returns all matches, whether content or files (issue in #7709 may be indicative). Which implies using searcher logic. But searcher doesn't do repo filtering, that happens in the frontend. So there is an interface to cut out here.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@mrnugget in https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/7790#discussion_r367877914:\r\n\r\n\u003e There's two problems we have to address:\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e   1. We need to reliably come up with a list of repositories over which to run Automation campaigns.\r\n\u003e   2. We need to find every search result in each one of these repositories.\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e With our current state of campaign types and our roadmpa, I think (1) is already (or can be made) reliable by restricting scopeQuery to only accept repo:. That should always give us the full list of repositories that match the scopeQuery.\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e The problem is that once you do that, you start to come up with a lot of false positives. Example: you run a NPM credentials campaign with \"scopeQuery\": \"repo:github\". That returns 200 repos, but only 3 of those have an .npmrc file. So I decided to add file:.npmrc to the scopeQuery. Problem is that, apparently, we're now not reliable anymore without adding count:99999 to it. For regex-search-replace the problem is even bigger, because it can yield more hits.\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e Problem (2) is what we're discussing this in this comment chain and now becomes more important with regex-search-and-replace and future campaigns that will run in the background and proactively scan/search repositories.\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e I hope that we, builders of code search, can up with a way that allows us to make use of the search infrastructure we already have in a reliable way 😄\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e  [... comment by @rvantonder ...]\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e This comment combined with your earlier comment makes me think again of the idea of combining searcher/replacer into a single service with added \"run code over git repo\" functionality.",

    "Title": "Redis AOF file grows unbounded due to frequent container restarts",
    "Body": "_Issue description written by @tsenart and copied here from another private issue._\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\n$CUSTOMER had a P0 incident due to the Redis AOF file not getting compacted as it should. It seems that the reason this happened is due to frequent container restarts.\r\n\r\nThe default Redis configuration for when the AOF file should get compacted is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Automatic rewrite of the append only file.\r\n# Redis is able to automatically rewrite the log file implicitly calling\r\n# BGREWRITEAOF when the AOF log size grows by the specified percentage.\r\n#\r\n# This is how it works: Redis remembers the size of the AOF file after the\r\n# latest rewrite (if no rewrite has happened since the restart, the size of\r\n# the AOF at startup is used).\r\n#\r\n# This base size is compared to the current size. If the current size is\r\n# bigger than the specified percentage, the rewrite is triggered. Also\r\n# you need to specify a minimal size for the AOF file to be rewritten, this\r\n# is useful to avoid rewriting the AOF file even if the percentage increase\r\n# is reached but it is still pretty small.\r\n#\r\n# Specify a percentage of zero in order to disable the automatic AOF\r\n# rewrite feature.\r\n\r\nauto-aof-rewrite-percentage 100\r\nauto-aof-rewrite-min-size 64mb\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn particular, `if no rewrite has happened since the restart, the size of the AOF at startup is used` is of particular concern and would explain what we're seeing. If the Docker container restarts frequently enough, redis won't have the chance to reach 100% of the previous AOF base size, so the next time around it starts up, it takes the AOF file size *at that point* as the new base over which it needs to double again. This can go ad-nauseum, theoretically.\r\n\r\n### Remediation\r\n\r\n$CUSTOMER is setting up monitoring of disk space usage and has a working playbook for manually triggering AOF file compaction.\r\n\r\n### Resolution\r\n\r\nAs far as I understand it, this seems like a design issue in Redis and it should only affect our Docker image deployment because of all the restarts that other processes can trigger.\r\n\r\n#### Action Items:\r\n\r\n1. [ ] **Create a work-around on our side**: Instead of relying on automatic background compaction, we can trigger it every-time after redis comes up. This can be done via the sourcegraph-frontend, or through a redis run script in `sourcegraph/server`.\r\n\r\n3. [ ] Open an issue (or find one) in Redis upstream.\r\n2. [ ] Figure out why the Docker container is restarting so often. See Relevant Logs section for a possible hint.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Incident Log\r\nhttps://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/GDS3PJ8GK/p1554732996001200\r\n\r\n### Relevant Logs\r\n\r\n[Similarly to what $CUSTOMER is seeing](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/viewer?authuser=1\u0026organizationId=1006954638239\u0026project=sourcegraph-dev\u0026resource=container%2Fcluster_name%2Fdogfood%2Fnamespace_id%2Fdefault\u0026minLogLevel=0\u0026expandAll=false\u0026timestamp=2019-04-08T17%3A13%3A40.800000000Z\u0026customFacets\u0026limitCustomFacetWidth=true\u0026interval=NO_LIMIT\u0026scrollTimestamp=2019-03-23T07%3A17%3A40.000000000Z\u0026pinnedLogId=jzf1w8f880bcc\u0026pinnedLogTimestamp=2019-03-23T07%3A17%3A03Z\u0026advancedFilter=resource.type%3D%22container%22%0Aresource.labels.cluster_name%3D%22dogfood%22%0Aresource.labels.container_name%3D%22sourcegraph-server%22%0Aresource.labels.namespace_id%3D%22default%22%0Aresource.labels.instance_id%3D%22355508537060902802%22%0Aresource.labels.zone%3D%22us-central1-a%22%0Aresource.labels.project_id%3D%22sourcegraph-dev%22%0Atimestamp%3E%3D%222019-03-23T07%3A13%3A00.000000000Z%22), our Dogfood docker deployment has seen occurrences where the container crashes for no apparent reason, followed by Redis errors on startup.",

Because of this, we need to tell the Sourcegraph image about this CA, or Git will complain:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfatal: unable to access 'https://github.example.com/user/repo.git': server certificate verification failed. \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe configuration option in [`github.certificate`](https://about.sourcegraph.com/docs/config/settings/#certificate-string) is available, but it only applies to Sourcegraph, not to processes that `gitserver` controls. As well, since it only seems to handle server certificates and not CAs, it will have to be updated every time the GitHub Enterprise server rotates its certs.\r\n\r\nOur workaround, which you are welcome to document, is to install the certificate in the Docker image, so the OS handles it. In a `Dockerfile`:\r\n\r\n```Dockerfile\r\nFROM sourcegraph/server:2.7.6\r\nCOPY ssl/certificate-authority.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates\r\nRUN /usr/sbin/update-ca-certificates\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning this derived image makes everything work magically, because Sourcegraph also trusts the CAs provided by the OS.",

Chatted with Dan and it sounds like we don't currently gate nor get pings back on usage of any of those \"Plus\" features (I think most notable ones are respecting repo permissions \u0026 extensions whitelist, but dan please chime in). Could we slot either a gate or at least a ping back/stats on those into the next release? Getting this info from clients will definitely impact new ARR as well as upsell potential.\r\n\r\nAnd my response:\r\n\r\n\u003eLooks like we DO have enforcement for this (see https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph@837b3b25d94e180864c7d1b7276a235a1ed9933a/-/blob/enterprise/cmd/frontend/internal/licensing/features.go#L19:2) but that we are not yet restricting it from basic Enterprise tier: https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph@837b3b25d94e180864c7d1b7276a235a1ed9933a/-/blob/enterprise/cmd/frontend/internal/licensing/features.go#L45:23\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003eSo this might be an easy update actually!\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003eBasically we just need to add the new tiers (Enterprise Plus and Elite) to our backend and update features to map to them: https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph@837b3b2/-/blob/enterprise/cmd/frontend/internal/dotcom/billing/plans.go#L27\r\n",

    "Body": "There are some improvements that can be made to the existing plugin interaction between Bitbucket Server and Sourcegraph.\r\n\r\n**Webhooks**\r\nWe can remove the unnecessary REST API to CRUD webhooks. There only needs to be a single webhook (that exist by default) to dispatch event payloads that are helpful to automation. This does not have to be configurable to the extent of changing event scope, name, etc.\r\n\r\nThe webhook can be toggled (on/off + secret) on the Bitbucket Server Sourcegraph admin page. The secret here will be used to HMAC sign payloads. The secret configured on Sourcegraph will have to match this one.\r\n\r\n**Configuration**\r\nClean up the BBS configuration on Sourcegraph. It is currently fragmented between the experimental site administration config (for faster permissions) and BBS external service (webhook secret). Ideally, everything will be moved to the BBS extsvc on a per instance basis.\r\n```\r\n\"plugin\": {\r\n  \"webhook\": {\r\n     \"secret\": \"secret\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"acl_endpoints\": {\r\n    \"enabled\": \"true\"\r\n  }\r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\n**Version** \r\nThe BBS plugin will expose a HTTP endpoint (`/version`) that the Sourcegraph instance can ping to discover which features are enabled/available.\r\n\r\nThis endpoint would return something like:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   \"version\": \"1.2\",\r\n   \"features: [\"acl\", \"automation-webhook\"],\r\n}\r\n```",

We might be able to avoid the database entry if we encode the username and hashed password in a token in the email confirmation link.

This can be simulated by sending a POST request to the build status BBS REST API.\r\n\r\nMore context: https://developer.atlassian.com/server/bitbucket/how-tos/updating-build-status-for-commits/\r\n\r\nSample payload from BuilldStatusSetEvent:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"createdDate\": \"2020-02-19T1:4:26-0500\",\r\n  \"user\": {\r\n    \"name\": \"admin\",\r\n    \"emailAddress\": \"admin@example.com\",\r\n    \"id\": 1,\r\n    \"displayName\": \"Administrator\",\r\n    \"active\": true,\r\n    \"slug\": \"admin\",\r\n    \"type\": \"NORMAL\",\r\n    \"links\": {\r\n      \"self\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"href\": \"http://localhost:7990/bitbucket/users/admin\"\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    },\r\n    \"avatarUrl\": \"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e64c7d89f26bd1972efa854d13d7dd61.jpg?s=64\u0026d=mm\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"commit\": \"797c7fd687ee59edee7a7665341e65b22e8d8bd2\",\r\n  \"status\": {\r\n    \"state\": \"SUCCESSFUL\",\r\n    \"key\": \"REPO-MASTER\",\r\n    \"name\": \"REPO-MASTER-42\",\r\n    \"url\": \"https://bamboo.example.com/browse/REPO-MASTER-42\",\r\n    \"description\": \"Changes by John Doe\",\r\n    \"dateAdded\": 1582092266068\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```",
