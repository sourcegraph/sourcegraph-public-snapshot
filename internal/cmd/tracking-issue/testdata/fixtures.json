  "Body": "### Plan\r\n\r\n**Goal:** Get the top three most popular language indexers: lsif-go, lsif-java, lsif-clang stable by working directly on implementation with customers to identify and resolve any remaining issues that prevent the tool from being use in a wide release. This goal takes top priority for this milestone and each member of the team is leading the initiative on an indexer. \r\n\r\n**Goal:** Improve the reliability and the precise code intel backend by migrating data away from SQLite and into a more suitable database, Postgres.\r\n\r\n**Goal:** Improve best effort auto-indexing for supported languages (see issues related to RFC 201).\r\n\r\n### Availability\r\n\r\nPeriod is from 2020-09-20 to 2020-10-20.

    "Body": "### Plan\r\n\r\n**Goal:** Get the top three most popular language indexers: lsif-go, lsif-java, lsif-clang stable by working directly on implementation with customers to identify and resolve any remaining issues that prevent the tool from being use in a wide release. This goal takes top priority for this milestone and each member of the team is leading the initiative on an indexer. \r\n\r\n**Goal:** Improve the reliability and the precise code intel backend by migrating data away from SQLite and into a more suitable database, Postgres.\r\n\r\n**Goal:** Improve best effort auto-indexing for supported languages (see issues related to RFC 201).\r\n\r\n### Availability\r\n\r\nPeriod is from 2020-09-20 to 2020-10-20.

Follow the documentation on this repo to create an lsif index of the chosen repository. For now, use the [simplify-cmake](https://github.com/sourcegraph/lsif-clang/tree/simplify-cmake) branch. If you're unable to create an index, file a bug documenting what you tried.\r\n1. Follow the sourcegraph documentation to upload the lsif index to sourcegraph.com, and confirm that the c++ codenav works (feel free to spend lots of time here, C++ is a strange beast so click on some strange code to make sure it's getting indexed properly!)\r\n1.

We'll provide updates on this issue as we learn more.\r\n\r\nCustomers: https://app.hubspot.com/contacts/2762526/company/407948923 ",

    "Body": "In preparation for [RFC 235](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y9p29hK8xrPUTvBdWqP9uAHDg3JLV-HCaxsbCo9-YHQ) which migrates LSIF data to Postgres: This PR introduces a new state for lsif_uploads, `deleted`, which acts as a soft-delete marker for upload records. The janitor is now responsible for hard deleting these records after cleaning up their associated data.\r\n\r\nIn the future, this will allow the janitor to more safely delete data associated with a missing record (if it's soft deleted we know it's not an accident; if it's missing we don't know if it's a part of a database backup, a misconfiguration, etc). There should be no user-observable behavioral changes in this PR.\r\n\r\nThis also does a bit of work required by https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/12168, as detailed in the related RFC.",
