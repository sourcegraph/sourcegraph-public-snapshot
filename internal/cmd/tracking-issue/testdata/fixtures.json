(Or somewhere better? I don't UI enough to know how to place buttons).\r\n  - In the code host extensions, this lives in the sourcegraph badge.\r\n  - When hovering the badge:\r\n    - the basic code intel state contains an explanation + CTA to add LSIF data\r\n    - the loading badge contains more information about indexing progress\r\n    - the precise code intel badge says which commit the data is coming from\r\n  - This information is only relevant for source files in languages we currently have good precise code intel support, so we should show it selectively\r\n- When hovering symbols:\r\n  - When code intel isn't yet available, there is an error/loading indicator with an explanation for why it's not available\r\n  - Otherwise, the hover card + find-ref results both also have the above badge\r\n\r\nBut I'm open to pushback/alternatives on everything.\r\n\r\ncc @sourcegraph/web, thoughts on all of this? and if you were to implement it, what would the timeline be?\r\n\r\nassigned to me while in planning phase, will re-assign/re-assess milestone when we decide what implementation looks like.",

      "Body": "When uploading lsif indices to a sourcegraph instance via src-cli, the command fails if cloning the repo is still in progress. The user would pretty much always retry the command, so we should just do that for them.\r\n\r\nIt'd be really simple to add this retry to the src-cli command, but could we alternately have the instance accept the upload instantly but not start processing until the repo is cloned? I assume this would be more work but not sure how much more. @creachadair @efritz ",

      "Body": "Converting LSIF uploads into SQLite databases can be a bottleneck for indexing large repositories. Processing a large upload can cause worker processes to exceed their RAM budget and terminate, and throttle or starve the processing queue.  \r\n\r\nUpload conversion currently runs on Node, mainly for historical reasons. As a step toward understanding and improving the performance of the conversion, we are going to start by re-implementing the [`convertLsif` function](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph@206177ad9c4aa5bd266e73d554c82628a95eeb8a/-/blob/cmd/precise-code-intel/src/worker/conversion/importer.ts#L40:23) that handles the core conversion logic in Go. This will make it easier for us to hook up CPU and memory profiling, without disrupting the existing worker logic too much.\r\n\r\nAs a temporary step, the worker will communicate with the converter via a pipe. Later, if this is fruitful, we'll investigate replacing more of the worker and remove that dependency.",
