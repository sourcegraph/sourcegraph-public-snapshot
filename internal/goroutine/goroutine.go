// Package goroutine provides a goroutine runner that recovers from all panics.
//
// This prevents a single panicking goroutine from crashing the entire binary,
// which is undesirable for services with many different components, like our
// frontend service, where one location of code panicking could be
// catastrophic.

// advanced use cases should copy this implementation and modify it.
