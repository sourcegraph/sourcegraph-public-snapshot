This is a vendored copy of the MIT licensed code
code.gitea.io/gitea@v1.18.0/modules/hostmatcher

This was done since depending on the full gitea source code created issues in
tracking dependencies due to the large number of deps that change in the gitea
project. In particular we had trouble updating and resolving a CVE from the
dependency.
