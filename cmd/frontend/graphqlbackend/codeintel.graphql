    """
    Returns the documentation pth info corresponding to the given path ID, where the empty string "/"
    refers to the current tree entry and can be used to walk all documentation below this tree entry.

    Currently this method is only supported on the root tree entry of a repository.

    See @documentationPage for information about what a pathID refers to.

    This method is optimal for e.g. walking the entire documentation path structure of a repository,
    whereas documentationPage would require you to fetch the content for all pages you walk (not true
    of path info.)

    If maxDepth is specified, pages will be recursively returned up to that depth. Default max depth
    is one (immediate child pages only.)

    If ignoreIndex is true, empty index pages (pages whose only purpose is to describe pages below
    them) will not qualify as a page in relation to the maxDepth property: index pages will be
    recursively followed and included until a page with actual content is found, and only then will
    the depth be considered to increment. Default is false.

    This returns a JSON value because GraphQL has terrible support for recursive data structures: https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/91

    The exact structure of the return value is documented here:
