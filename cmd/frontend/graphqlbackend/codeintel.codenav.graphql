    Here, usagesForSymbol for (1) will return a Definition usage for Animal.sound().
    Similarly, usagesForSymbol for (2) will return a Definition usage for Dog.sound().

    In the general case, a symbol may have multiple definitions.
    Here are some examples:

    1. Python allows for multiple inheritance, so the same field can
       be declared in multiple parent classes. In such a situation,
       even Precise results may have multiple definitions.
    2. A function may have different definitions based on the build
       configuration, such as for macOS vs Windows. A precise SCIP indexer
       may unify all such definitions into a single index as SCIP
       currently (as of June 20 2024) doesn't support tracking build
       configuration.
    3. Syntactic or search-based results may not be able to find the
       exact definition, so they may return a superset of the full set
       of definitions.
    """
    DEFINITION

    """
    Denotes a usage as being a reference. References are unified across
    the inheritance hierarchy. For example, consider the following pseudocode:

    interface Animal:
        sound()

    class Dog implements Animal:
        sound() override { ... }

    func makeSounds(animal: Animal, dog: Dog):
        animal.sound()

        dog.sound()
    #       ^---^ (2)

    Here, usagesForSymbol for both (1) and (2) will return Reference usages
    for both Animal.sound() and Dog.sound().
    - For (1), it makes sense to also return reference usages for Dog.sound()
      because 'animal' may actually be a Dog.
    - For (2), it makes sense to also return reference usages for Animal.sound()
      because 'dog' value may be up-cast to Animal at some point and the
      and 'sound()' might be called on it after that.
    """
    REFERENCE

    """
    Denotes a usage as being an 'implementation', generally of a method, interface
    or similar (the exact terminology varies across languages - traits, protocols etc.).

    For example, consider the following pseudocode:

    interface Animal:
    #         ^----^ (1)
        sound()
    #   ^---^ (2)

    class Dog implements Animal:
        sound() override { ... }

    Here, usagesForSymbol for (1) will return an Implementation usage for Dog.
    Similarly, usagesForSymbol for (2) will return an Implementation usage for Dog.sound().

    As of June 20 2024, Implementation usages are only supported by
    Precise indexers. Syntactic and search-based usagesForSymbol will mark all
    such usages as Reference.
    """
    IMPLEMENTATION

    """
    Denotes a usage as being a 'super', generally of a method, type or similar.
    The exact terminology varies across languages and the syntax under question -
    for functions, it might be 'superclass method', 'interface method', 'trait method' etc.
    and for types, it might be 'superclass', 'interface', 'trait' etc.

    For example, consider the following pseudocode:

    interface Animal:
        sound()

    class Dog implements Animal:
        sound() override { ... }

    func bark(dog: Dog):
                   ^-^ (1)
        dog.sound()
            ^---^ (2)

    Here, usagesForSymbol for (1) will return a Super usage for Animal.
    Similarly, usagesForSymbol for (2) will return a Super usage for Animal.sound().

    As of June 20 2024, Super usages are only supported by
    Precise indexers. Syntactic and search-based usagesForSymbol will mark all
    such usages as Reference.

    UI note: Strictly speaking, depending on the exact symbol and language under
    consideration, 'Super' usages would be better be grouped under a heading like:

    - Method specification (for methods satisfying the signature of an interface
      method in Go or Java)
    - Interface (for types implementing an interface in Go or Java)
    - Trait method (for methods satisfying the signature of a trait method in Rust)
    - Trait (for types implementing a trait in Rust)

    and so on. Due to this large variation across languages, we've chosen
    to group all such usages under 'Super' for now.

    Historical note: This was previously called 'prototype' in the old API.
    However, 'prototype' has a specific meaning in C++ different from our usage,
    so we recommend avoiding the term 'prototype' in the UI.
