	//
	// To calculate this we use the number of packfiles tracked by the multi-pack index:
	// the difference between the total number of packfiles and the number of packfiles
	// tracked by the index is the amount of packfiles written since the last geometric
	// repack. As we only update the MIDX during housekeeping this metric should in
	// theory be accurate.
	//
	// Theoretically, we could perform a geometric repack whenever there is at least one
	// untracked packfile as git-repack(1) would exit early in case it finds that the
	// geometric sequence is kept. But there are multiple reasons why we want to avoid
	// this:
	//
	// - We would end up spawning git-repack(1) on almost every single repository
	//   optimization, but ideally we want to be lazy and do only as much work as is
	//   really required.
	//
	// - While we wouldn't need to repack objects in case the geometric sequence is kept
	//   anyway, we'd still need to update the multi-pack-index. This action scales with
	//   the number of overall objects in the repository.
	//
	// Instead, we use a strategy that heuristically determines whether the repository
	// has too many untracked packfiles and scale the number with the combined size of
	// all packfiles. The intent is to perform geometric repacks less often the larger
	// the repository, also because larger repositories tend to be more active, too.
	//
	// The formula we use is:
	//
	//	log(total_packfile_size) / log(1.8)
	//

	//
	// -----------------------------------------------------
