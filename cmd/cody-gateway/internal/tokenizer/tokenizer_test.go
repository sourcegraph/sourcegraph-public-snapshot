It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.`,

If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.`,

Human: I want you to use a document and relevant quotes from the document to answer the question "{{QUESTION}}"

Here is the document, in <document></document> XML tags:

{{DOCUMENT}}

Here are direct quotes from the document that are most relevant to the question "{{QUESTION}}": {{QUOTES}}

Please use these to construct an answer to the question "{{QUESTION}}" as though you were answering the question directly. Ensure that your answer is accurate and doesn’t contain any information not directly supported by the document or the quotes.

Human: I am going to give you a sentence and you need to tell me how many times it contains the word “apple”. For example, if I say “I would like an apple” then the answer is “1” because the word “apple” is in the sentence once. You can reason through or explain anything you’d like before responding, but make sure at the very end, you end your answer with just the final answer in brackets, like this: [1].

Do you understand the instructions?

Assistant: Yes, I understand. For a given sentence, I should count how many times the word "apple" occurs in the sentence and provide the count as my response in brackets. For example, given the input "I would like an apple", my response should be "[1]".

Human: Correct. Here is the sentence: I need one apple to bake an apple pie, and another apple to keep for later.

Hi -- My Mixmaster4000 is producing a strange noise when I operate it. It also smells a bit smoky and plasticky, like burning electronics.  I need a replacement.
